This should make the Pro Pixel a bit better at dealing with fingerprints. Either route, the Pixel is a nice-looking smartphone, and Google’s created some uniformity with the rest of its devices. I’m particularly fond of the new Bay, a baby-blue-like shade, for the Pixel 8 Pro. Both are still resistant to water and dust as well.</p>", "<p>Google’s flagship Pixel 8 Pro is sticking with a familiar 6.7-inch Super Actua display brighter than the screen on Pixel’s 7 Pro and now sports an adaptive refresh rate that scales from 1Hz to 120Hz. This way, it can speed up when you’re in a game or scrolling a spreadsheet for a natural viewing experience, but it doesn’t need to pull on the battery constantly. The Pixel 8 is smaller year over year with a 6.2-inch Actua display that peaks with a buttery smooth 120Hz refresh rate. It’s only 0.1-inch smaller than the Pixel 7, but this should make the device a bit more manageable in the hand. </p>", "<p>Both sport a pinhole notch centered near the top of both screens, and it hides the 10.5-megapixel ultra-wide front facing camera. This should be plenty for video calls and snapping selfies.</p>", "<p>The most exciting part of the <a href=\"https://howl.me/ckIMkaPkEnf\">Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro</a> live on the back, though, and it will likely pay to spend the extra cash if you care about photography. The standard Pixel 8 sticks with a 50-megapixel main lens and a 12-megapixel ultra-wide lens. Shooting with either will showcase improved processing and more accurate colors, but a new Macro Focus mode will let you take extreme close-ups. </p>", "<p>Google’s Pixel 8 Pro aims to compete with the iPhone 15 Pro Max and Galaxy S23 Ultra with a triple-camera array. It starts with a dependable 50-megapixel wide main lens similar to the 7 Pro but pairs it with a 48-megapixel ultra wide lens and a 48-megapixel telephoto. Optically, you can shoot from 0.5 to 5x without digital zoom, and Google’s SuperRes Zoom aims to deliver clear shots at up to 30x. </p>", "<p>The upgraded camera hardware, software, and AI improvements should make both setups quite stellar. </p>", "<p>Under the hood, Google is powering the <a href=\"https://howl.me/ckIMlKFQzfk\">Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro</a> with the Tensor G3. This is the third generation of a made-by-Google chip, which should make for a very fluid experience on the device. Everyday apps like dialing out on the phone, texting, writing an email, browsing the web, playing a game, and capturing life’s daily moments with a camera should all fly with no issues. </p>", "<p>Google is promising that the latest processor should deliver an improvement over both the Pixel 7 and Pixel 6 phones, but specifically noting that it’s better at handling AI (artificial intelligence) features. So removing an object or a person from your photo with “Magic Eraser” should wrap faster, and the Call Screen feature should feel more instantaneous.</p>", "<p>You can still charge the Pixel 8s hardwired via USB-C or with any Qi-enabled wireless charger. The <a href=\"https://howl.me/ckIMlKFQzfk\">Pixel 8</a> features a 4,575 mAh battery, while the Pixel 8 Pro gets a larger 4,950 mAh battery. With either, Google promises all-day use and multiple days with “Extreme Battery Saver” enabled.</p>", "<p>All-in-all, the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro are shaping up to be excellent smartphones and some of the best Android phones to launch this year.

Hiram Johnson, a Republican who held his seat from 1917 to 1945.</p>", "<p>Feinstein broke many gender barriers: First woman to serve as a U.S. senator from California (Sen. Barbara Boxer was sworn in two months later), first woman to chair the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Senate Rules Committee, and first woman to be top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee.</p>", "<p>She also became known as a fierce advocate for gun control legislation. Feinstein authored the 1994 assault weapons ban, and after it expired in 2004 continued to push for its revival.</p>", "<p>Feinstein also got notice when she chaired the Intelligence Committee from 2009 to 2015. She guided a lengthy review of the Central Intelligence Agency’s controversial enhanced interrogation program, which resulted in findings that led to legislation barring the use of torture.</p>", "<p>The final years of her career, when she struggled with failing health, were marked by controversy over her decision to remain in office. Her condition triggered a broader national discussion about age and power, and whether elected officials should be subject to age limits.</p>", "<p>Dianne Goldman was born in San Francisco. She attended Stanford University, first as a premedical student and then majoring in political science and history. She graduated in 1955.</p>", "<p>Feinstein married Jack Berman, a San Francisco judge, in 1956. Their daughter Katherine would become presiding judge of the San Francisco County Superior Court.</p>", "<p>She divorced Berman in 1959 and married neurosurgeon Dr. Bertram Feinstein.

Geraldine Ferraro. </p>", "<p>A 1990 campaign ran for governor against then-Sen. Pete Wilson fell short by about 3 percentage points. Two years later, she ran for the Senate seat Wilson vacated, defeating Gray Davis, a Democrat who would win the governorship six years later.</p>", "<p>The Senate Judiciary Committee, chaired by then-Sen.Joe Biden of Delaware, was under withering criticism in 1991 for its handling of Clarence Thomas’ nomination to the Supreme Court. Law professor Anita Hill had accused Thomas of sexual harassment, making her case before a committee with all white men.</p>", "<p>Feinstein joined the committee after her election in 1992 and had an immediate impact. </p>", "<p>In January 1993, President Bill Clinton nominated Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. General Counsel Zoe Baird as attorney general.Baird, who would have been the first woman to serve in the job, was criticized for hiring a nanny and chauffeur who were in the country illegally and for not paying their Social Security taxes.</p>", "<p>Instead of a sharp grilling, Feinstein tried to draw out the human side of the story, asking Baird about her family and her feelings.</p>", "<p><a href=\"https://www.courant.com/news/connecticut/hc-xpm-1993-01-23-0000106947-story.html\">She urged Baird </a>to stop talking in legalese. Explain why you did this, Feinstein urged. </p>", "<p>Baird tried, explaining how difficult it was to start a new job at Aetna, where people whispered she was too young, while raising an 8-month-old son.</p>", "<p>But Baird showed little emotion. Feinstein went on to another subject. She made no comment about Baird’s response, and the subtle message was that Feinstein was not sure about the Baird nomination.</p>", "<p>Baird soon withdrew from consideration.</p>", "<p>Feinstein would soon become well-known for her gun control advocacy. With a Democrat in the White House and the party controlling both chambers of Congress, President Bill Clinton in 1993 and 1994 was eager to pass strong gun control legislation. </p>", "<p>The nation had been rocked by several incidents, including the massacre at Stockton’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlV4_-7QyAQ\">Cleveland Elementary School</a> in 1989 where a gunman killed five people and wounded 34.</p>", "<p>Feinstein would author the assault weapons ban, which stayed in effect for 10 years. Efforts to revive it have been unsuccessful.</p>", "<p>Feinstein led the highly secret intelligence panel from 2009 to 2015, when serious questions were being raised about American interrogation techniques during the Iraq War and against suspected terrorists.</p>", "<p>The committee’s report on the CIA’s “enhanced interrogation techniques” was a<a href=\"https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/the-intelligence-committee\"> 6,700 page explanation</a> — with 38,000 footnotes — of why the agency’s tactics were not useful.</p>", "<p>Among its findings were that the CIA “provided extensive inaccurate information about the operation of the program and its effectiveness to policymakers and the public.” It called the program’s management “inadequate and deeply flawed.”</p>", "<p>And it found the program was “far more brutal” than the CIA had told the public.</p>", "<p>The report led the Senate to vote overwhelmingly to ban enhanced interrogation.</p>", "<p>Feinstein’s liberalism had an establishment bent, which frustrated the progressive wing of the Democratic party. </p>", "<p>When Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., mobilized party liberals and challenged President Jimmy Carter in 1980, Feinstein backed Carter. She initially<a href=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/press-release-california-senator-dianne-feinstein-endorses-hillary-clinton\"> supported Hillary Clinton</a> for president in 2008 over Barack Obama, and once it became clear Obama would be the nominee, Feinstein hosted the two candidates in her<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/06/06/clinton.obama.wrap/index.html\"> Washington living room</a>. </p>", "<p>In 2020, Feinstein was an early Biden supporter, even though California Senate colleague Kamala Harris was considering a bid.</p>", "<p>Feinstein explained at the time “I’m a big fan of Sen. Harris, and I work with her. But she’s brand-new here, so it takes a little bit of time to get to know somebody.” Harris became a senator in January 2017.</p>", "<p>Since she first sought statewide office, Feinstein was seen as more moderate. Those were years when state voters were electing Wilson and, later, Republican Arnold Schwarzegger. She won re-election in 1994 with 46.7% in a multi-candidate field and got 55% in 2000.</p>", "<p>Feinstein has long been considered a consistently loyal Democrat, though, and in 2021, <a href=\"https://adaction.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2021.pdf\">Americans for Democratic Action, </a>which rates loyalty to liberal causes, gave her a 100% rating.</p>", "<p>Still, critics in recent years have wanted more aggressive action on some of their favorite initiatives, such as single-payer health insurance.</p>", "<p>In 2018, the state Democratic Party <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/feinstein-loses-california-democratic-partys-endorsement/2018/02/25/6c752f60-1a44-11e8-9de1-147dd2df3829_story.html\">denied Feinstein its endorsement</a>, giving a majority of its votes to then-state Sen. Kevin de Leon, known in the state legislature for his aggressive championing of climate change, helping undocumented immigrants, and more. </p>", "<p>“California Democrats are hungry for new leadership that will fight for California values from the front lines, not equivocate on the sidelines,” de Leon said at the time.</p>", "<p>Feinstein defeated de Leon in the general election with 54%.</p>", "<p>In recent years, Feinstein’s ability to do her job under was under increasing scrutiny.</p>", "<p>The Judiciary Committee’s hearing on Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett in late 2020 was highly contentious and partisan. Democrats assailed Republicans for jamming her nomination through the Senate before the election. Yet Feinstein called the sessions “one of the best set of hearings that I’ve participated in.” She thanked Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and gave him a hug.</p>", "<p>Many<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/10/16/feinstein-hug-graham-hearings/\"> Democrats were outraged</a> at Feinstein’s behavior and questioned whether she was qualified to continue as the committee’s top Democrat. She would have chaired the committee the following year, but stepped aside.</p>", "<p>The drama was less intense in 2022 when Feinstein became next in line to become Senate president pro tempore. The largest ceremonial position traditionally goes to the longest-serving majority party senator. But it’s got one crucial feature that appeared to be problematic: The job makes the senator third in the line of presidential succession.</p>", "<p>Feinstein said she was not interested, and it went to Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington.</p>", "<p>Feinstein made a final return to the Senate on May 10, after being absent for three months recovering from shingles and other ailments. She used a wheelchair, said little, was constantly surrounded by her staff and clearly lacked the vigor and obvious savvy of her earlier years.</p>", "<p>She issued a statement explaining she’d be pursuing a “lighter schedule.”</p>"]},

The county released a health alert last week citing the spike in suspected overdose deaths.</p>", "<p>More than 60% of the overdose deaths have been due to <a href=\"https://www.modbee.com/living/health-fitness/article273890745.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"Follow\">illegal fentanyl</a> sold by drug traffickers. The county Coroner’s Office has recorded 81 fentanyl deaths since Jan. 1. This year’s running total stood at 47 in July, indicating a recent spate of fentanyl fatalities.</p>", "<p>Vartan said the numbers are preliminary as the county goes through a process of confirming overdose deaths.</p>", "<p>Drug cartels are combining fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, with heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine. It’s also being put in counterfeit pills that resemble prescription drugs like Xanax, Oxycontin, Percocet and Adderall. Only about 2 milligrams of fentanyl may cause a fatal overdose.</p>", "<p>In an email to The Modesto Bee, Vartan said the recent data puts the county on pace to exceed the overdose death tolls in 2022 and 2021. The county had 128 fentanyl deaths in 2022 after 97 were recorded in 2021 and 60 in 2020.</p>", "<p>In another concerning development, Vartan said local drug treatment programs have anecdotal evidence and lab results showing that people are using “tranq” on the streets of Modesto and other cities. Tranq is fentanyl mixed with the veterinary medicine called xylazine.</p>", "<p>When it’s injected, the illegal drug causes skin lesions and serious infections. Health experts say that naloxone, often distributed as Narcan nasal spray, is ineffective for people who overdose on xylazine.</p>", "<p>Dr. Lyn Raible, who has worked in substance use treatment in Stanislaus County, said tranq has been available in the county for a couple of months.</p>", "<p>“If the East Coast is any indication, and it almost always is, we haven’t seen the worst of tranq yet,” Raible said in a text. “That xylazine is being seen with increasing frequency in Stanislaus County is not surprising, but it is deeply concerning because it is even more dangerous than fentanyl.”</p>", "<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, xylazine is an animal tranquilizer that can be life-threatening for people, and it’s especially dangerous when mixed with fentanyl. </p>", "<p>Raible said trafficking of xylazine has been moving westward across the United States, multiplying the dangers of fentanyl by increasing overdose deaths and causing other health problems for users.</p>", "<p>Experts believe there is no reversal agent for xylazine because it’s a tranquilizer, not an opioid. For those who overdose and stop breathing, the chances of survival are artificial respiration until the drug wears off, said Raible, a member of the county Opioid Safety Coalition.</p>", "<p>Administering naloxone is <a href=\"https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/xylazine#:~:text=In%20the%20event%20of%20a,is%20frequently%20combined%20with%20opioids.&amp;text=However%2C%20because%20xylazine%20is%20not,impact%20of%20xylazine%20on%20breathing.\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"Follow\">still recommended</a> for a suspected tranq-related overdose, because xylazine is often combined with opioids that do respond to Narcan, says the National Institute on Drug Abuse.</p>", "<p>People injecting tranq often develop severe wounds that are difficult to treat, including skin necrosis or rotting tissue. Xylazine causes blood vessels to constrict and prevents antibodies and antibiotics from reaching the infections, Raible explained. The most severe cases may require amputation.</p>", "<p>The fentanyl crisis has created a <a href=\"https://www.modbee.com/news/local/article274996666.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"Follow\">dangerous landscape</a> of recreational drug use for teenagers and <a href=\"https://www.modbee.com/news/local/crime/article279739339.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"Follow\">younger adults</a>.</p>", "<p>County BHRS said parents play a pivotal role in preventing substance abuse and accidental overdoses among their children.

Even though Hernandez is now a free woman living in Texas, she is still subject to the whims of CDCR’s price-gouging as a person who supports incarcerated loved ones. When Hernandez receives word that one of her incarcerated friends needs something, she mobilizes with groups of formerly incarcerated women to raise funds. Without this sisterhood of support, many of Hernandez’s incarcerated friends would have to go without the bare essentials.</p>", "<p>Legislation now on Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk from Senator Josh Becker (D-Menlo Park) could help women like Hernandez who support incarcerated loved ones, as well as the more than 92,000 people incarcerated in CDCR facilities. In its current amended version, <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB474\" target=\"_blank\">Senate Bill 474</a> would prohibit CDCR prisons from charging more than a 35% markup above the amount paid to vendors until January 1, 2028. This would dramatically lower prices — a recent audit found that canteen products are marked up an average of 65% of the amount paid to the vendor. </p>", "<p>Because prisons have a monopoly over the people they incarcerate, they are able to gouge prices far beyond retail prices in order to maximize profit. It’s often impossible for incarcerated people — who earn between 8 and 37 cents an hour — to afford these prices. At California State Prison Solano, toothpaste costs $4.45 (compared to the market rate of $1.38), a markup of over 200% that could require 37% of an incarcerated person’s monthly income.</p>", "<p>An eight ounce package of coffee can cost $9, as much as 75% of an incarcerated person’s income. Only in a forced monopoly can these kinds of prices exist. In the free world, a consumer would simply shop elsewhere. With the lowest-paid people in the country being charged the highest prices for basic necessities, the expense often falls to their loved ones.</p>", "<p>“Imagine having to stretch $21 (a month) for hygiene,” Hernandez said, citing the health risks and social humiliation of not being able to afford soap or menstrual products. Even when her family sent her money, a portion of the funds went toward restitution fees. And many in prison don’t have anyone on the outside to offer financial support.</p>", "<p>April Harris, who is currently incarcerated at California Institute for Women, receives support from her mother, stepfather and three friends, including Hernandez. Yet, for the first five or so years of her incarceration, she didn’t have the same level of financial support and could not afford supplemental food items from the canteen. </p>", "<p>Restricting canteen price-gouging wouldn’t just help incarcerated people, but also their families, who “pay both the apparent and hidden costs” of incarceration, according to a 2015 <a href=\"https://ellabakercenter.org/who-pays-the-true-cost-of-incarceration-on-families/#:~:text=The%20True%20Cost%20of%20Incarceration%20on%20Families.,DOWNLOAD%20THE%20REPORT%20NOW!\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> published by the Ella Baker Center, an SB 474 cosponsor.<b> </b>Decades of “unjust criminal justice policies have created a legacy of collateral impacts that last for generations and are felt most deeply by women, low-income families and communities of color,” the report continued.</p>", "<p>Prison-related costs for loved ones can have debilitating ripple effects. A <a href=\"https://www.becauseshespowerful.org/the-report/\" target=\"_blank\">survey of 2,281 women</a> published in 2018 by Essie Justice Group found that 35% of respondents experienced homelessness, eviction or an inability to pay housing costs on time as a result of their loved one’s incarceration.</p>", "<p>San Francisco has already succeeded in ending markups in its city jail’s commissaries, a change the city enacted in 2019. On a national level, no other states have yet passed such legislation, though <a href=\"https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?231+ful+SB889\" target=\"_blank\">Virginia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.leg.state.nv.us/App/NELIS/REL/82nd2023/Bill/10425/Text\" target=\"_blank\">Nevada</a> are also fighting for similar legislation. </p>", "<p>In addition to Newsom signing SB 474, future legislation could address the prices of items in the catalogs from which incarcerated people and their loved ones can order quarterly packages. Harris also wonders if CDCR could spend the inmate welfare fund differently, perhaps using the funds to include better, name-brand products in the indigent kits.</p>", "<p>Hernandez recalls a time when prisons allowed outside packages to be sent in, rather than requiring families to send packages from these approved vendors. As someone who is now sending, rather than just receiving these packages, Hernandez thinks that allowing outside packages would be cheaper and logistically smoother. </p>", "<p>“I think it would be a lot easier… for us out here,” Hernandez says. “To be able to help the ones that are in there.”</p>"]},

McCarthy knew he would need the backing of Trump supporters in the House to become speaker.</p>", "<p>As was abundantly shown by the House committee that investigated the rioting and efforts to reverse the results of the 2020 presidential election, Trump played the leading role in trying to overcome the will of voters. And yet McCarthy put a stamp of approval on him, allowing Trump to remain relevant on the national stage.</p>", "<p>Since becoming speaker in January, McCarthy made appeasing the hard-right members a key goal. The chief example is his allowing <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/hunter-biden-impeachment-inquiry-house-republicans-51576c5fe4294be2605a14fa81075196\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\">an impeachment inquiry</a> to begin against Biden, despite any lack of evidence that the president has done anything wrong, and after promising that the full House would get to vote to start any such inquiry. No such vote was taken. Democrats were furious that such an investigation was started.</p>", "<p>On his social media, McCarthy routinely blasted Democrats as socialists hell-bent on ruining America. Yet when two financial crises confronted the nation in recent months — the national debt limit and the federal budget — McCarthy found a way to compromise with Democrats to get deals that were needed.</p>", "<p>But those deals were cited by the hard-right Republicans as evidence that McCarthy should not remain the speaker.</p>", "<p>One could feel sorry for McCarthy because the narrow margin he had to work with made his job seemingly impossible.</p>", "<p>But there is no excuse for the deference he paid to Trump nor the blind ambition he showed to become speaker. McCarthy cast his lot with Trump and Trumpism, and is now joining the ranks of people broken by their association with the worst president in U.S. history.</p>"]},

The department reveals the answer at 4 p.m.</p>", "<p>Here are five of the most recent “Weird Wednesday” driving law-related questions posted on the department’s Facebook page and what the answers are (plus, links to more Bee coverage on the topics):</p>", "<p><b>Are construction zone speed limits still in effect if there is no construction going on?</b></p>", "<p>Even when no one is working at the time you travel through a construction zone, the lowered speed limit must be obeyed, according to the CHP.</p>", "<p>The speed limit signs posted in construction zones aren’t just for the safety of workers — you legally should follow them at all times. </p>", "<p>“Often, construction zones have a change in the nature of the roadway — a change that you may not be expecting,” the CHP wrote. “The changes could include lack of shoulder, narrow shoulder, narrow lanes or a lack of striping on the roadway.”</p>", "<p><b>If you are at a red light where it is legal to turn right on red, the person in front of you is beyond the white limit line and you are right up against it, do you have to pull up more and stop again before safely proceeding to turn?</b></p>", "<p>The answer to this question is both yes and no, the CHP says.

He was used much more toward the end of the season after Blake Corum suffered a season-ending injury and Mullings was used more as a goal-line back. </p>", "<p>Now in 2023, Mullings has established himself as RB No. 3 behind Corum and Donovan Edwards. Through five games, Mullings has 100 yards on 15 carries and a score. He is averaging 6.6 yards per carry which is the highest between Corum, Edwards, and Mullings. </p>", "<p>On Wednesday, running backs coach Mike Hart called Mullings special and he can do it all.

He's got good vision. He's got good hands. He can pass pro. He can do it all. He's just been growing week by week.

Hart says he really doesn't know until the game starts. He gives everyone equal reps during practice, but once the game starts it's all about the flow of the game. </p>", "<p>He did tell the media that Corum and Mullings are his short-yardage backs, so those two will get more opportunities there, but it's all about the ebbs and flows of the game.  </p>", "<p>\"Practice, we roll,\" stated Hart. \"Guys get reps, we try to give equal reps in practice so everybody can get those opportunities with the same plays.

Really, as you get into the game, it's flow and how I feel. It's really just gut, to be honest with you. Blake has a bunch of carries and I want to take short-yardage off him and put Kalel in the game and give Kalel some of those reps.\"</p>", "<p>\"Same thing if it's a long drive, you put Donovan in the game. Donovan always goes in the third drive of the game as a starter in the backfield. That's the consistent thing that I do. Besides that, it's just game flow. Is it a long drive? Donovan will get in early. You just go with the flow. If it's a long drive then you gotta take Blake out and put Donovan in and get Kalel in and do what he have to do. I really don't decide how many reps they're going to get, how many carries they're going to get before the game. It just depends on how they're running and who is running the best. Those are the guys who are going to get the carries.\"</p>", "<p>You will get a chance to see Mullings in action once again this Saturday night when Michigan faces Minnesota.

How the 70-year old diner came back from a fire", "date": "August 31, 2023, 12:27 PM.", "body": ["<p>Since it opened in Turlock in 1952, Latif’s restaurant has lived through the moon landing, the rerouting of Highway 99 and a visit from a future president of the United States.</p>", "<p>So, clearly, a little fire wasn’t going to keep it from continuing to witness history and feed generations of Central Valley customers. The region’s quintessential midcentury diner reopened in mid-August in its longtime Golden State Boulevard home after being closed for two and a half years for repairs and renovations. </p>", "<p>Back and as classic Turlock as ever, Latif’s by Pedretti has relied on its deep Valley roots to survive and rebuild after the <a href=\"https://www.modbee.com/news/local/turlock/article249090215.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\">Super Bowl Sunday kitchen fire</a> in 2021 that closed the site. </p>", "<p>“I couldn’t go anywhere without having to talk about (the restaurant),” said owner Nick Pedretti, who <a href=\"https://www.modbee.com/news/business/biz-columns-blogs/biz-beat/article278830499.ece\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\">took over ownership in November 2019</a>. “It’s crazy how supportive Turlock has been to get us back open.”</p>", "<p>Pedretti is only the third owner of the business in its more than 70-year history. He bought it from the Stevens family, which had purchased the restaurant from original owner Charles Latif in the 1970s and who helped build up its reputation and famous pie business.</p>", "<p>The restaurant actually started next door (in what is now a jewelry shop), before its founder Latif decided to build a new diner in 1959. At the time, Highway 99 ran right in front of the building before it was rerouted and the original road was renamed Golden State Boulevard. </p>", "<p>While freeway traffic may have helped the diner thrive in its early days, Turlock residents have been its mainstay ever since as generations of diners have come through its doors. Pedretti said it’s not uncommon to see grandparents, their kids and their kids’ kids all eat together. </p>", "<p>Pedretti’s family has its own storied history in the Stanislaus County city. He is the grandson of Ezio “Atch” Pedretti, the well-known Turlock High coach and namesake of the city’s Pedretti Park. To pay homage to his family’s local legacy, Nick added the “by Pedretti” when he took over Latif’s almost four years ago.</p>", "<p>Since then, his ownership has been interrupted by a series of unforeseen events. First, three months after his purchase, all restaurants were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Then, just as indoor dining was restarting in earnest, the fire shut the site down again. </p>", "<p>The restaurant has now reopened for breakfast and lunch until 2 p.m. daily. On Sept. 8, hours will expand to early weekend dinner service Friday and Saturday until 7 p.m.</p>", "<p>In many ways, it’s like Latif’s was never closed. The regulars are back, Pedretti said, coming in to help brew coffee as the morning crew arrives before doors officially open at 6 a.m. weekdays. Many of the staff are back too, including longtime chef Rodrigo Blanco, who has been with Latif’s for some 30 years.</p>", "<p>“We’ve been waiting for more than two years for this,” said Blanco, who relied on odd jobs and other work with Pedretti during the closure. “We’re so happy to be back.”</p>", "<p>Also back are the organizations that have called the upstairs banquet room home for years, including the Turlock Rotary, Kiwanis and Quarterback clubs, which have all resumed regular weekly meetings. The room, which can be reserved for private events, was remodeled due to fire damage with new flooring and audiovisual upgrades. </p>", "<p>Not back to full force quite yet are Latif’s legendary pies. The niece of longtime piemaker Paula Loomis is handling the bakery and training staff to get back up to speed on the restaurant’s much loved sweet treats. For now, pies are available only on the weekends. Pedretti advised pie fans to get any holiday orders in early this year, as there will be a limited number made and they are expected to sell out fast. </p>", "<p>Still, loyal Pedretti’s diners are happy just to have their longtime favorite back. Hilmar resident Kathy Vaz and a friend came for lunch last week, and while they missed out on the pie, they were thrilled to return to its familiar booths. </p>", "<p>“I think it’s wonderful to have it back,” said Vaz, who said she has been coming to the establishment for 60 years, since she was a young girl. “It’s always been a great place to eat and it’s good it is family-owned.”</p>", "<p>The menu is largely back as well, especially its popular morning fare including the breakfast sliders and breakfast burritos. Pedretti has added some new options to the lunch menu, including the Nashville hot chicken sandwich and bacon habanero burger ($16 and $17, respectively). They’ve reopened with an expanded craft beer and wine selection as well. </p>", "<p>The restaurant’s iconic look, and signs, have remained. The downstairs flooring and booths are the same. But the back kitchen had to be completely rebuilt. Also, all of the ceilings, both on its main and upstairs floors, were replaced. To comply with ADA rules, another exit and bathroom were added on the first floor. </p>", "<p>But the cinder-block walls and color-block windows are all still there, and the interior is decorated with archival images of the restaurant through the years. Also, don’t worry, the plaques on the chairs once sat on by former President George H. W. Bush and his wife Barbara Bush (he was vice president at the time of the visit and campaigning before he was elected later that year) are still proudly displayed. </p>", "<p>Pedretti said he was able to survive the long closure and rebuilding process thanks to help from his family and friends, though he had to take out loans for some expenses. The complicated insurance claim process slowed down the rebuilding effort. But the struggle, he said, has been worth it. </p>", "<p>“During (the closure) in my mind I always thought, ‘I’ve got to get this place open again.’ You have those sleepless nights,” Pedretti said. “(Reopening) means everything, it means family again. It’s one of the main reasons to reopen a place like this....A couple of groups have four generations coming back here. It’s awesome to see them showing their kids what they did when they were little.”</p>", "<p>Latif’s by Pedretti’s, at 11 N. Golden State Blvd in Turlock, is open 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday to Saturday and 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. Sunday (dinners until 7 p.m. Friday and Saturday start Sept. 8).

Plus, the portions are generous — the cookies are somewhere between the size of a compass and a Frisbee — and they are presented in elegant pink boxes, sort of like on Ted Lasso.</p>", "<p>In other words, a lot goes into a Crumbl, but $5 is still steep for one cookie.</p>", "<p>The real sticker shock, though, is the “suggested” tip schedule on the touchscreen: The options in my store are $2, $3 and $4.</p>", "<p>Yowsers!</p>", "<p>If I did the math right, a $2 tip on a $5 purchase works out to 40%.</p>", "<p>Of course, a $2 tip is not mandatory. There is a “custom tip” choice, but that requires more thought and more keystrokes, which can be awkward if there’s a long line of customers.</p>", "<p>Then there’s the option of leaving no tip at all.</p>", "<p>Not a good idea if you plan on becoming a regular, or if you don’t want to embarrass yourself in front of the customer standing directly behind you, breathing down your neck.</p>", "<p>In case you’re wondering where those gratuities wind up, “All tips are allocated amongst our bakers,” according to Candyce Paige, PR strategist for Crumbl.</p>", "<p>“Our process is standard of most food and beverage processes with a tip screen being showcased as part of the buying experience. However, this is <i><b>optional</b></i> and customers are able to select $0 or no tip,” she added in an email.</p>", "<p>I don’t begrudge tipping the Crumbl staffers, who are both patient and unwaveringly pleasant.

Not anymore. At least, not according to an often-quoted Feb. 23 article in New York magazine, called<a href=\"www.grubstreet.com\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"Follow\"> “The New Rules of Tipping.”</a></p>", "<p>“At restaurants, the previous and ethically expected tip was 15 to 20 percent; now it’s 20 to 25,” the magazine advises. “The higher your disposable income, the more you should tip, but anything under 20 percent is rude.”</p>", "<p>Oh, and if you’re at a coffee bar, tip at least 20%, unless you’re buying just a plain coffee, in which case you can get away with tipping $1.</p>", "<p>“If you’re buying an item that involves no preparation (a bottle of water, a muffin) it is acceptable, though miserly, not to tip,” the article continues.</p>", "<p>In other words, according to the tipping culture of today, we’re misers if we don’t tip the person who puts a muffin (or a cookie) in a bag (or a box) and hands it across the counter.</p>", "<p>Yet at the same time, we aren’t expected to tip an employee at a shoe store who may bring out a dozen different pairs of shoes for us to try ... and still not make a single sale.</p>", "<p>Go figure.</p>", "<p>Apparently, not many Californians got the memo about the new tipping etiquette; Golden Staters are the worst restaurant tippers <i>in the nation</i>.</p>", "<p>We tip a measly average of 17.5% on restaurant meals, <a href=\"https://pos.toasttab.com/news/q4-2022-restaurant-trends-report-valentines-super-bowl-tipping-data\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"Follow\">according to TOAST</a>, a digital technology platform for the restaurant industry.

Yes, the goal is always to win. But when broken down, it often means taking chances when it traditionally doesn’t seem to make sense. </p>", "<p>It is a mantra many in sports recognize, but few follow. </p>", "<p>Escalon coach Andrew Beam is not one of those few anymore. And multiple times during the Cougars 21-14 win in their Trans-Valley League opener against Hughson, he proved it. </p>", "<p>Beam coached his team to a fourth-down goal line stand in the first quarter, engineered an eight minute fourth-quarter drive to put the game away and called a passing play in the fourth quarter, on fourth down with his team backed up on its own 36 yard line.</p>", "<p>“You’ve got to play to win, not to lose,” Beam said. “And I’ve learned that over my career the hard way sometimes. We wanted to be able to control this game and keep it in our own hands.”</p>", "<p>With the Cougars (5-1, 1-0 TVL) ahead 14-7 early in the fourth quarter, a holding penalty backed them up to the 24-yard line. On second-and 16, they gained eight yards and on third-and-eight they gained four, setting up a fourth-and-four. Without hesitation, Beam sent his quarterback Donovan Rozevink and the offense back on the field. The senior quarterback found junior Ryan Lewis along the Escalon sideline for a 19-yard completion to give the Cougars a first down.</p>", "<p>“We just installed that play this week,” Lewis said. “Jamin Miller goes up the field and they don’t expect me to run a route, so right behind him, I just ran the out route and it was there. Great play by coach Beam.</p>", "<p>“Coach Beam has always done that. He’s a risky guy and it was a smart call. We got the first (down).”</p>", "<p>That play was part of a patented Escalon football drive that essentially sealed the win. More than eight minutes, stretching from the end of the third quarter to the 4 minute, 8 second mark in the fourth quarter. </p>", "<p>Escalon ran 18 plays, mixing the run and pass to methodically move the ball 81 yards. When they needed to, they made plays to extend the drive. </p>", "<p>Talan Reider, Josh Graham and Jamin Miller hit holes on power runs and Rozevink found ways to extend drives on third and fourth down, connecting with his receivers. Rozevink connected with Lewis on second and goal for the drive-ending, five-yard touchdown. </p>", "<p>“Our plan coming into the game was to waste time, run it down their throats,” said Rozevink, who threw a touchdown pass and rushed for a score. “Just keep running the ball and pass every once in a while. We had a couple big plays on that drive on third-and-long.”</p>", "<p>While key plays through the air kept possessions alive, the contest was still an old-fashioned, ground-and-pound TVL battle. </p>", "<p>Josh Graham rushed for 98 yards and a touchdown on 21 carries for the Cougars and David Burns had a breakout game at fullback for Hughson with 110 yards and a touchdown on 11 carries.

For one thing, McCarthy did not put the matter to a full vote in the House. Additionally, even some GOP House members, like Ken Buck of Colorado and Don Bacon of Nebraska, have said no evidence warranting impeachment proceedings has yet surfaced.</p>", "<p>No matter. McCarthy is plunging forward, and his statements Tuesday made clear he thinks President Biden is guilty of corrupt dealings when it comes to his son Hunter’s former businesses.</p>", "<p>“House Republicans have uncovered serious and credible allegations into President Biden’s conduct,” McCarthy told reporters in a brief press conference in the Capitol. “Taken together, these allegations paint a picture of a culture of corruption.”</p>", "<p>Are there “high crimes and misdemeanors,” as required for impeachment? That remains to be seen. Biden and leading Democrats have characterized McCarthy’s “impeachment inquiry” as absurd and a travesty, with no shred of truth.</p>", "<p>For months some House GOP leaders have said that Hunter Biden traded on his father’s political stature to further his business interests., including when the elder Biden was vice president under Barack Obama.</p>", "<p>The proof will be in the evidence, and so far, there is none truly tying President Biden to any real corruption. Even the Wall Street Journal, hardly a promoter of Democrats, said this in its Wednesday edition: “No evidence has emerged to show the president benefited from Hunter Biden’s endeavors, nor that he wielded government authority to favor them.”</p>", "<p>McCarthy once noted that Americans have no appetite for goose chases when it comes to something as serious as impeaching a sitting president. His point is verified by history.</p>", "<p>Democrat President Bill Clinton <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections#:~:text=However%2C%20the%20Republicans%20lost%20five,Congressman%20Dennis%20Hastert%20of%20Illinois.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\">was impeached in 1998</a> by the GOP majority in the House over lying about his affair with a White House intern.

Their majority was narrowed as a result.</p>", "<p>To be sure, McCarthy had little choice in deciding to enter impeachment waters. The far-right members of the GOP’s Freedom Caucus have made it clear they will look to replace him as speaker if McCarthy does not meet their demands. Among them is impeaching Biden. </p>", "<p>This again demonstrates the central weakness of McCarthy as speaker. He literally must jump to the tune of the most extreme members of his caucus or else. McCarthy is simply not strong enough to stop his most belligerent members from abusing an impeachment process that should be a last resort, not a tool, to settle political scores.</p>", "<p>As much as Republicans want to be seen as the party of truth-seeking, an “impeachment inquiry” is as political as it gets. McCarthy and his GOP better bring the goods, or else voters will tell them in no uncertain terms that craven politics is unacceptable.</p>"]},

Pearson, to my question, answered a succinct “no.”</p>", "<p>Horn said he also wasn’t worried about physical threats, but added, “It’s not like a hometown crowd for me,” he said of the Johnson County location, and he worried there would be little support from the audience. “Folks (in the trans community) didn’t even want to show up to support, so I was going to be in front of people who thought I was…” his voice trailed off, but then he continued.</p>", "<p>“I can debate with them, that’s fine, but trans folks and trans parents believed some of these panelists had actively betrayed them.”</p>", "<p>Pearson said they also had concerns. “Following the pre-planning meeting, we had concerns about the opposing panelists ability to remain civil and respectful.” </p>", "<p>Smith of APS said she heard the concerns and tried to convince Horn and Pearson that it would be OK. “We would never let certain behavior occur, but they felt it was not a conversation they could participate in.”</p>", "<p>Which is sad, considering the changing views of gender and tenor about identity in the nation. In Missouri, 0.2% or 9,500 of adults identify as transgender. In Kansas, 0.56% or 12,400 individuals age 13+ identify as transgender. Those numbers come from a <a href=\"https://americanpublicsquare.org/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=grassblade_launch&amp;t=1695754636&amp;content_id=ODg0MA\">fact sheet</a> provided by APS, but originate from <a href=\"https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Trans-Pop-Update-Jun-2022.pdf\">a 2022 study.</a> </p>", "<p>Horn said Kansas City transgender community members were most concerned about giving Jamie Reed a platform. Reed recently has been a lightning rod on the topic of transgender medical transition. Her story about becoming a <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article274573836.html\">whistleblower while she was a case manager</a> in a children’s hospital affiliated with Washington University in St. Louis has been featured in many media outlets, and she has been vilified by many in the transgender community.</p>", "<p>I asked Reed her thoughts on what happened with the panel during a phone conversation. “I’m disappointed,” she said. “I was open to a challenging dialogue.”</p>", "<p>Reed took issue with labeling Kansas City’s transgender community, especially on medical transition for adolescents. </p>", "<p>“There is not a unified and monolithic community that shares the same values on these topics,” she said. “There is a divide within the LGBT community within this topic, and that is OK to have different points of view, and it is OK for adults to discuss those things. I think it hurts our community to pretend like we are so fragile that we cannot have tough debates.”</p>", "<p>She said the transgender community missed an opportunity to bring out differing views, for example, she argued that she does support medical transition for adults. “I think the panelists and I actually agree on a lot of concerns and questions. But there is so much nuance to medical intervention with kids and adolescents right now that our community will be hurt more if we cannot discuss these things.”</p>", "<p>She said she would participate if the program is rescheduled. “I would like to see it occur.”</p>", "<p>I have to admit that when I first heard about the American Public Square program, I was impressed they had decided to tackle such a big conversation. And when I heard it was postponed, I was disappointed. Certainly, it was going to be a complicated but essential confluence of diverse and divergent perspectives. We need to address identity, intolerance and understanding. We need help figuring out how to talk to each other. Data shows it.</p>", "<p>A 2021 survey from Public Agenda/USA Today/Ipsos Hidden Common Ground found that most Americans believe <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/polarization-december-2021\">political hostility and divisiveness is a serious problem</a> in the U.S., and that 3 in 10 Americans are most worried about the fact that Americans don’t know how to talk about their disagreements and conflicts in constructive ways.</p>", "<p>Allan Katz, founder and CEO of American Public Square at Jewell, said it’s better to be exposed to opinions that you disagree with. “It’s that exposure that will help us all better understand the complexities of the issues we face as a nation and, perhaps, find common ground in the process.”</p>", "<p>But Horn and Pearson said there are certain things that you simply can’t debate. </p>", "<p>“We knew our community needed to be represented,” Horn said, “but when we’re suffering and fighting for our lives, I do not want to defend my existence to you, nor do I have to.”</p>", "<p>I’m glad that Kansas City has groups like American Public Square and United We promoting conversation — all different, but all fighting for the voices of diverse communities to be heard. On this issue, however, there doesn’t appear to be a clear path forward.</p>", "<p>The APS program is “postponed,” not canceled, said Smith. “That (wording) was intentional. We wanted to pause and catch our breath. We can’t say where we will go from here but we think it’s important to sit down and have this conversation.”</p>", "<p>Pearson said they do believe that conversations can and should be had around gender identity “that respect the personhood, humanity, and dignity of all persons,” but in the end, “We believe we made the right choice in the circumstances.”</p>", "<p>Horn agrees, conditionally. “It’s going to be tough moving forward. We’re slipping back so far because we just have to defend our existence. There are some things that are not up for debate, the ability for people, if they want to, to live up to their authentic self.”</p>"]},

Dianne Feinstein?</p>", "<p>On the plus side, Newsom kept his promise to appoint a Black woman to the seat, and he didn’t waste any time in doing it.</p>", "<p>But the whole process was made unnecessarily uncomfortable by Newsom’s announcement that he would make an “interim” appointment, which was thought to mean that he would appoint someone to keep the seat warm until the November election.</p>", "<p> He also said he would not be choosing from among the current candidates for the Senate seat so as not to give any one of them an edge.</p>", "<p>That left Rep. Barbara Lee, a Black lawmaker from Oakland, out of the picture, even though she was easily one of the most qualified candidates and obviously wanted the job.</p>", "<p>Then Newsom changed the rules again. The governor’s office now says the appointee is free to run for a full term, contradicting the notion that this is just a seat-warming situation.</p>", "<p>“If that person decides she wants to seek a full term in 2024, then she is free to do so,” a Newsom spokesman told The Los Angeles Times. <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-10-02/newsom-laphonza-butler-feinstein-senate-seat-flipflop\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"Follow\">“There is absolutely no litmus test, no promise.”</a></p>", "<p>Say what?</p>", "<p>Newsom ended up with a rationale that a current candidate could not be the appointee. But now the appointee can become a candidate. How would that person not have an incumbent’s edge in the race, which was exactly what Newsom was trying to avoid?</p>", "<p>It’s unclear whether Butler will choose to run for the full term. </p>", "<p>She hasn’t commented on that, though there’s been lots of speculation in the media that it would be awfully difficult to raise enough funds with the primary election day just five months away.</p>", "<p>Also, the two front-runners — Rep. Adam Schiff and Rep. Katie Porter — already have sizable leads; a <a href=\"https://escholarship.org/uc/item/78p1042g\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"Follow\">recent poll</a> shows them as the only candidates in double digits.</p>", "<p>Yet the 44-year-old Butler does have youth on her side — many voters are now thinking twice about electing candidates in their 70s and 80s — and if she can make a strong impression in Washington in a short amount of time, she could be a competitive candidate.</p>", "<p>One thing: If Butler were to join the already crowded field of candidates — and no one else dropped out — that would split the Democratic vote even more. </p>", "<p>Since California has a <a href=\"https://www.sanluisobispo.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/article278615519.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"Follow\">top-two primary </a>— meaning the two highest vote-getters advance to the general election, regardless of their political party — that would make it even more likely that a Republican could windup on the November ballot, rather than two Democrats. And if there were an election today, that one Democrat would likely be Schiff or Porter.</p>", "<p>Butler’s appointment was a surprise to many and an indication that no Californian with the legislative portfolio for such a high appointment would take the job. Butler’s name did not appear on the lists of possible appointees drawn up by political insiders — most likely due to the fact that she no longer lives in California and has never held elected office. She moved to Maryland in 2021.</p>", "<p>However, Newsom has said Butler was the “only choice” to fill the seat.</p>", "<p>Butler does have an impressive record of accomplishment; she’s been a union leader, a regent for the University of California, an adviser to Vice President Kamala Harris and she’s most recently served as president of Emily’s List, a powerful organization that works to elect Democratic, pro-choice women.</p>", "<p>As a young, Black lesbian woman, she will bring some much-needed diversity to a chamber that’s still predominantly white, straight and male. And she will be a strong voice for working people at a time when they are stretched thin by rising interest rates, high housing prices and wages that never go far enough.</p>", "<p>Still, there’s no denying that she lacks prior legislative experience, and will undoubtedly need some time to get up to speed in her new role.</p>", "<p>Also, the fact that she’s been living in Maryland doesn’t sit well with some voters, who question why the governor couldn’t have tapped someone closer to home. </p>", "<p>Still, Butler deserves our congratulations, along with the honeymoon period granted to all new elected officials.</p>", "<p><span>Welcome back to California, Sen.

Ronald Reagan won praise for dismantling the state mental hospital system and for recognizing the harm done by institutionalizing people while depriving them of liberty. Many documented abuses were done to the mentally ill in the name of protecting society.</p>", "<p>But succeeding leaders did not provide resources for suitable local alternatives to institutionalization, leading in part to the homelessness crisis of today. An argument can be made that California traded inhumane lock-ups of the mentally ill for the streets.</p>", "<p>The hotly debated <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-01-01/care-court-challenges-orange-san-diego-counties\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"Follow\">CARE Court program</a> championed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, <a href=\"https://www.modbee.com/news/politics-government/article274468725.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"Follow\">now under development</a>, deserves a chance to determine if it can work. CARE Court works this way: By December of 2024, all 58 California counties must create new court systems to serve people suffering from severe mental illness. Family members, mental health specialists, first responders and others can petition these new courts to compel treatment for people suffering from schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders.</p>", "<p>The courts would evaluate each case and prescribe 12 to 24 months of treatment. People who refuse treatment could be considered for conservatorship.</p>", "<p>Compelling treatment is controversial. For some, conservatorships are too reminiscent of the old state hospital system that was discredited and abolished in Reagan’s day. This is a primary reason some civil rights groups and disability advocates have filed lawsuits against CARE Court.</p>", "<p>Their concerns are understandable. But too often, the alternatives to conservatorship are incarceration and homelessness.</p>", "<p>One solution is <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-03-01/legislators-propose-changes-to-californias-conservatorship-law\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"Follow\">reforming conservatorships</a> to make treatment more widely available without overly impinging on people’s rights. That is the primary goal of Senate Bills 43 and 363, both by Sen. Susan Eggman, whose similar legislation last year received bipartisan support but failed to win a committee hearing in Sacramento.</p>", "<p>Despite ongoing opposition, enthusiasm for conservatorship reform may be building at the Capitol, in part because of turnover in lawmakers at the election last fall. That momentum is a good sign.</p>", "<p><a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB43\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"Follow\">SB 43</a> would expand the “gravely disabled” standard for compelling treatment. Currently, too many of our most vulnerable do not receive treatment if they demonstrate that they are capable of the most minimal self-care. Under SB 43, treatment would be expanded to those suffering mental incapacity because of substance abuse — making thousands more homeless eligible for help. The bill specifically asks courts to take into account whether someone understands their illness and is able to make sound decisions.</p>", "<p>Its companion bill, <a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB363\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"Follow\">SB 363</a>, would create a real-time dashboard that providers could check for open beds in often overcrowded psychiatric and substance abuse facilities throughout California.</p>", "<p>SB 43 received unanimous support in two votes of separate Senate committees in recent weeks, and no senator voted against SB 363 in three committee votes. Both have yet to reach the Senate floor, and would require approval in the Assembly and by the governor. But support so far bodes well for loved ones of the seriously mentally ill — and taxpayers watching them suffer, whether on the streets or behind bars.</p>", "<p>People with serious mental illness often don’t know they’re sick, and often are incapable of seeking the help they need. Providing needed treatment demonstrates compassion, not coercion.</p>", "<p>California’s current approach is not working. It’s broken, and has been for decades — a fact even opponents of conservatorship acknowledge.</p>", "<p>“We’re still operating on laws that were a good idea at one point in our history and have now become obsolete and a barrier to care, versus a protection for people,” Eggman said upon <a href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/article272630321.html\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"Follow\">unveiling the legislation</a> earlier this year.</p>", "<p>SB 43 and 363 represent another tool in the effort to fix the most troubling problems afflicting California: mental illness leading to homelessness or incarceration.

She got her start cooking at downtown’s Harvest Moon before leaving for college in New Orleans where she also continued her chef work. The Modesto native <a href=\"https://www.modbee.com/news/business/biz-columns-blogs/biz-beat/article233322362.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\">opened the craft cocktail spot</a> in the summer of 2019, but had only a few months of operation before the pandemic shut the bar down for more than a year. </p>", "<p>Earlier this year, after the December closure of <a href=\"https://www.modbee.com/news/business/biz-columns-blogs/biz-beat/article269421072.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\">longtime small plates restaurant Concetta</a>, Lo-Fi began to serve food with the help of former Concetta head chef Nathan Heese. Jamieson had asked Concetta owner Paul Tremayne if it was OK to poach Heese and some of his popular recipes for her bar. With his blessing, Heese began serving weekly small plate menus mid-February. </p>", "<p>The rotating menu is, you guessed it, experimental. While there are a couple of staples, including the much-loved Concetta deviled eggs with shrimp on top, the rest is whatever looks good, is freshest and seems fun for the Modesto chef.</p>", "<p>A Downey graduate who worked at Concetta the last two years, Heese has also cooked at other popular downtown spots like Skewers and Commonwealth. He has brought over some other Concetta favorites besides the deviled eggs, like the Brussels sprouts and pork scallopini.</p>", "<p>But then, pretty much, he makes whatever else he feels like. He has had free reign over the next-door kitchen since he started.</p>", "<p>“I wanted to be part of the experimenting and creativity here,” Heese said. </p>", "<p>Each week he creates a new menu, which is served Wednesday to Saturday nights. You can find the offerings posted on the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/loficocktails/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\">bar’s Instagram page</a> most weeks. Much like the bar itself, which does not have an official sign, you kind of have to be in the know to find it.</p>", "<p>But those who do will find everything from yellowtail sashimi and roasted cauliflower tacos to Duxelles pinwheels (mushrooms in pastry) and smoked salmon on cucumber crostinis. Each week’s menu has about eight items to choose from, including a dessert pick. The shared plates range from about $9 to $15 each.</p>", "<p>When he started at Lo-Fi, Heese had the option to do regular dinners or small plates again, and decided to stick with the shareable dishes but make them change regularly.</p>", "<p>“I think if you have a rotating menu it gets people excited about what is coming next,” he said. </p>", "<p>Small plates with seasonal menus are also more sustainable and easier to source and supply, cutting out some of the issues restaurants have had since the pandemic with the cost and availability of certain foods. It’s a trend being embraced by more area restaurants, including nearby <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/patrickchinn11/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\">Chinn’s International</a> which finished renovations and opened this January in the former Concetta space. </p>", "<p>Lo-Fi’s own renovations of the adjoining restaurant have taken longer to complete.

Jamieson will go back to her kitchen roots and cook the breakfast, brunch and lunch fare. Like with her cocktail lounge, do-it-yourself experimentation will be on full display.</p>", "<p>Expect it to start with a limited menu and schedule, with brunch on Saturday and Sunday. She doesn’t have a timeframe for when the hours will expand yet. Like the Lo-Fi cocktail lounge, the restaurant will have murals by local artists on the walls and other eclectic touches. </p>", "<p>Just as the bar side makes all of its own juices, syrups, mixers and garnishes, the restaurant will make its own sauces and even sweet confections like marshmallow and chocolate syrup. You can expect to see breakfast favorites, like French toast, but with a twist of an unusual filling or topping. </p>", "<p>And Jamieson said they’ll work their way up to making their own sodas too, as the name suggests. </p>", "<p>“I’ll be experimenting with flavor combinations and things like that,” she said. “I don’t ever have a set plan in mind.

The large block letters came from the old Oakdale Theatre, which closed in the 1960s, said husband-and-wife co-owners Matt and Kelly Budine. The longtime Oakdale couple wanted to reflect the city’s history while giving residents a new, modern place to eat and gather. </p>", "<p>The result is Bistro 120, named for the highway running in front of its doors, an “elevated casual” restaurant they hope will appeal to tourists headed to the Sierra Nevada and locals fresh off the farm. </p>", "<p>The new eatery, in the former Cafe Bliss space across from the House of Beef, has been completely remodeled and expanded. When the long-running cafe closed amid the pandemic in summer 2020, the Budines saw an opportunity. Matt Budine is co-founder and CEO of the successful Oakdale-based dairy nutrition and management company <a href=\"https://progressivedairysolutions.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\">Progressive Dairy Solutions</a>, which feeds 11% of the cows across the country. </p>", "<p>Kelly works at the company in administration but said they were looking for a business they could own together. Initially, they were silent partners on the project, but then with the scope of the changes, the pair took over the renovations and business as their own in the fall of 2020.</p>", "<p>The Budines hired a restaurant consulting firm to help them capture their vision. The interior has been rebuilt, with a new kitchen, 16-foot ceilings and back expansion that nearly doubles the restaurant’s seating capacity. The Highway 120-facing facade and entrance have been redone, and a larger main entrance has been added, facing the back parking lot along Third Avenue.</p>", "<p>About a year into working on the remodel, the next-door hobby shop also became available. The couple snapped up the 2,000-square-foot space to transform into an accompanying event center. Once completed, that space is expected to hold around 80 people and be rented for private and business events. Currently awaiting plan and permit approvals, they hope to have the center done in December.</p>", "<p>While that phase of the project is in the works, the restaurant has made a grand entrance onto the Oakdale dining scene this summer and already has attracted repeat customers. That includes Oakdale resident Kim Leverett, who has eaten at Bistro 120 five times since it opened a little more than a month ago.</p>", "<p>“The food is super good and the service is excellent,” she said while lunching with a friend who was visiting the restaurant for the first time. </p>", "<p>The Budines said they wanted a high-quality, flavor-packed menu that featured a diverse selection of small plates, entree salads, sandwiches, burgers and dinner options. The restaurant uses only U.S. prime cuts and has a selection of upscale American Wagyu beef dishes as well. All the dressings, sauces and soups are made in house.</p>", "<p>The priciest item on the menu is the $68 surf-and-turf featuring a filet mignon and jumbo garlic prawns. The selection of half a dozen entree salads ranges from the all-vegetarian Farm Fresh ($17) to the seared ahi tuna salad ($22). Most burgers and sandwiches, including the popular Cowboy Capital Cheeseburger and Prime French Dip, run $16 to $21 and are served with fries.</p>", "<p>The restaurant also has a full bar with a selection of specialty craft cocktails, as well as about 30 varieties of wine. The Budines plan to add to the wine list, eventually increasing it to about 100 options.</p>", "<p>Matt Budine said that to him, “elevated casual” means an attention to detail in the food, with a welcoming atmosphere.</p>", "<p>“We welcome everybody, no matter if you just came off the ranch or just got done working the cows or if you have a fun cocktail dress and a nice dress-up shirt. Come in and experience a great vibe here at Bistro 120,” he said.</p>", "<p>The restaurant is also one of the few full-service, sit-down spots in the city that’s open for lunch and dinner seven days a week.

Before that, she spent almost eight years at Ohio’s Center of Science and Industry, which since its founding in 1964 has been one of the leading educational outreach museums in the country. She served as its director of education strategic initiatives and director of education programs.</p>", "<p>A graduate of Ohio State University, Webster has a bachelor’s degree in psychology and a master’s degree in early childhood education.</p>", "<p>And then there was her time on the long-running reality dating competition. Webster appeared on “The Bachelor” franchise’s 18th season. She said her time on national television taught her valuable lessons that remain applicable to her work today. </p>", "<p>“It was a really, really big, big lesson in communicating what I think effectively and honestly,” she said. “And I think it’s really helped me understand being a visible figure and how I represent myself both in the public and private sphere.”</p>", "<p>The Modesto museum is under construction on 11th Street in the former longtime Fat Cat Music House &amp; Lounge space, with the aim of a summer opening. </p>", "<p>With Webster on board, organizers will be able to solidify plans past opening day. The day-to-day operation of the center will include daily visits, membership enrollment, classes, events, outreach and other programming. Webster said she is inspired by the museum’s development, championed and organized by community members, and excited to help create something new for the Central Valley. </p>", "<p>“What really hooked me from the get-go was the grassroots efforts; it felt really like a movement from within the community,” she said. “We want to create world-class operations, world-class staffing from the first day it opens. It’s the opportunity that comes with a blank slate.”</p>", "<p>Once the interior renovations are complete, the museum’s interactive exhibits will be installed. Those pieces are being fabricated off-site by internationally renowned exhibit makers Kubik Maltbie and Boss Display and should be done in the spring. </p>", "<p>The center’s <a href=\"https://www.modbee.com/entertainment/article272627290.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\">recent announcement of $9 million in donations</a> means its capital campaign is fully funded and ongoing fundraising will go toward operations and programming. It expects to hire a full- and part-time staff of about 20, as well as have volunteer staffing.</p>", "<p>Webster was selected out of 70 applicants in a nationwide search. Modesto Children’s Museum Board President Katie Barber said the museum was looking for a CEO with a strong leadership track record who was forward-thinking and focused on community engagement, financial management and experimental learning.</p>", "<p>And while it may seem that Webster’s experience on the televised dating show might not factor into her role as a children’s museum chief executive, Barber said that kind of high-profile media experience only enhances what she brings to the position. </p>", "<p>“Media experience in a CEO position is crucial. Since our founding, our team has provided numerous on-camera interviews, and we expect to be working closely with many media outlets for years to come,” Barber said. “(H)er media experience is just the icing on the cake — Chelsie’s leadership and ingenuity in the field of early childhood education, her passion for young learners and her enthusiasm for MoChiMu have been unmatched since our first meeting.”</p>", "<p>Webster’s “Bachelor” days came almost a decade ago. She joined the popular reality franchise in 2014, at age 24, as one of 27 single women vying to fall in love with the titular bachelor in the series’s name. Her season featured former Venezuelan professional soccer player Juan Pablo Galavis.</p>", "<p>Launched in 2002, the dating show has one “Bachelor” or “Bachelorette” each season who must pick between a large field of eligible romantic partners, and ends with that person giving their “Final Rose” to his or her choice followed usually by an on-screen proposal. </p>", "<p>Webster went far on her season, making it through seven weeks of the 10-week season and ending up fifth overall.</p>", "<p>The following year, she appeared on the second season of the “Bachelor”/”Bachelorette” spinoff series “Bachelor in Paradise,” where eliminated contestants from previous seasons stay on a Mexican beach resort and date each other in an attempt to be the last couple standing. She was briefly on the series, joining on its fifth week and leaving that same week. </p>", "<p>But, through it all, Webster has been an educator at heart. She even brought it into her time on “The Bachelor,” introducing herself to Galavis with a science experiment and a pun about “chemistry.” </p>", "<p>Almost a decade later, Webster said she doesn’t get recognized from the show as much as she gets the “you look familiar” and “did we go to high school together” questions. She called her time with the franchise a “roller coaster” but also “really, really wonderful opportunity” to see the world. Her season filmed in South Korea, Vietnam and New Zealand, among other picturesque locales. </p>", "<p>“The show itself allowed me to be really thoughtful about how I communicate with others and what experiences I decide to let impact me or not,” she said. “(It gave me) humility and understanding that how you act in the world matters. And there’s no better way to learn that than to be in front of 10 million people on television.”</p>", "<p>While she isn’t connected with the series currently, Webster said the recent announcement about her appointment in Modesto saw some of her franchise castmates reach out with congratulations. </p>", "<p>And, for those wondering, Webster has found love. She got married last fall and her new husband, who works in logistics for a major healthcare company, has moved with her to Modesto.</p>", "<p>So while she enjoyed her time in the limelight, Webster said those days are very much in the past. </p>", "<p>“It was a fun time, but it was almost a decade ago and it feels like talking about when I swam in high school. Like, oh yeah, I did that,” she said.</p>"]},

See what’s changed", "date": "September 25, 2023, 6:00 AM.", "body": ["<p>Mention Chicken Barn to longtime Modestans and they might get a faraway look in their eyes as they reminisce about the chicken nuggets, valley sauce and days when it was called Foster Farms Fried Chicken to Go.</p>", "<p>Now, the longtime Modesto fried chicken restaurant has young new owners who recently completed a renovation with hopes of keeping the Chicken Barn name an area favorite for years to come. But, rest assured, the husband-and-wife team in charge of the McHenry Village eatery haven’t changed the recipes or the beloved valley sauce.</p>", "<p>Modesto residents Madison and Randy Cory, both 24, took over the Modesto brand at the end of 2021 from the family that had run it for decades. Since then, they’ve been saving up and slowly making changes. In late April, they closed the Oakdale Road branch of the restaurant in The Lakes shopping center.</p>", "<p>Late last month, they completed the interior remodel of the original McHenry Avenue location. Madison Cory said they hope the new lighter, brighter dining room sends the message that a new generation of owners is ready to take Chicken Barn into the future. </p>", "<p>“We’re really excited that it just feels new,” said Madison Cory, a Modesto native and former Gregori High tennis star. “We wanted to show that there are new owners who care about (this restaurant). And also we wanted to put some of our own character and vibe into it.”</p>", "<p>Madison and her husband, Randy Cory, who grew up in the Monterey area, met when they were 14 years old and playing at a tennis tournament. They’ve been together ever since, first settling in Utah with new jobs after college in 2021. But then two days after they got engaged, Randy was diagnosed with cancer. </p>", "<p>It was then that Madison’s father offered to help them purchase the Chicken Barn to support themselves so they could move back to Modesto to be near family during Randy’s treatment. In late December 2021, they took over the restaurants. Since then, Randy Cory has been declared cancer free and the couple have put all their energy into reinvigorating the Chicken Barn. </p>", "<p>They tore down some divider walls in the dining area, which has created one large open space with new seating for about 70. The walls are now crisp white with a fresh gray border. Only the building’s signature ceiling, with its wooden planks vaulted like a barn, remains the same. </p>", "<p>The restaurant’s history stretches back to the 1950s, when Foster Farms had a dairy plant at the corner of McHenry and Briggsmore avenues, across from the current Chicken Barn in McHenry Village. </p>", "<p>In 1968, Foster Farms opened its first restaurant in front of the McHenry Avenue plant. The eatery sold the company’s fried chicken for takeout until around the mid-1980s. Then it moved across the street into its current McHenry Village spot where it continued operating. </p>", "<p>The plant was closed in 2003 to make way for a new retail complex. That same year, longtime Foster Farms employee Roy Bradley and his wife, Amy, bought the restaurant and renamed it Chicken Barn. They opened their second location on Oakdale Road in 2009.</p>", "<p>Like when the Bradleys took over, the Corys have continued using the original recipes for their fried offerings. They have all the same suppliers and all the chicken is breaded in house, as are their signature deep-fried potato wedges, called “spuds.” They have made some menu adjustments, like removing a teriyaki chicken bowl and a shredded chicken sandwich. They’ve also introduced new mac and cheese and mashed potato recipes.</p>", "<p>The much-loved valley sauces (essentially a sweet ranch) remains exactly the same. But they’ve swapped out and added others like honey mustard, Nashville hot and mango habanero sauces. </p>", "<p>Since taking over, the couple also made some price adjustments, increases that Madison Cory said were necessary because of bird flu-related shortages and inflation. To combat rising costs for customers, the restaurant offers a different combo special each day at a discounted price. </p>", "<p>The menu is simple, offering fried chicken pieces, sandwiches and nuggets. Chicken sandwich combos (fried or grilled) run $10.79 and include a side and a drink. Meanwhile, the nugget combos start at $10.79 for five nuggets and go up to $80.99 for 50 nuggets (sides, biscuits and dipping sauces included). </p>", "<p>And about those nuggets: The big chunks of whole white breast meat taste as juicy as you remember, as they should, because the poultry still comes from Foster Farms. The Corys have changed the restaurant fry oil to a healthier premium canola oil, which they said is cleaner than the old soybean oil used before. </p>", "<p>The young couple also have brought the brand into the internet age, launching Chicken Barn’s first website (<a href=\"https://www.chicken-barn.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\">www.chicken-barn.com</a>) and its own free app (which can be used for online orders and loyalty programs). You’ll also find one or both of the Corys at the restaurant talking with their customers and employees almost every day. </p>", "<p>The new restaurateurs also have plans for expansion. They hope to open a second location again, with an eye this time toward Turlock. If it proves successful, there could be even more locations in the Chicken Barn’s next chapter. </p>", "<p>“Our real goal is to get this one up and running exactly how we want it so we can expand and essentially copy and paste everything,” Madison Cory said. </p>", "<p>While the Corys look to the future, plenty of their diners fondly remember the restaurant’s past. Their mailman, Dave Costa, has been dropping in for regular lunches since he started the route 32 years ago. Also eating in the newly refurbished dining room last week was former Foster Farms employee Jim Norquist, who worked with the company in the 1980s and met his wife at the restaurant for lunch. </p>", "<p>“All these other chicken places have come in, but we always prefer here,” he said. “I love (the new look). Eating here is like comfort food for me.”</p>", "<p>Chicken Barn, at 1700 McHenry Ave. in Modesto, is open 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. weekdays and 11 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays.

Barbara Lee, D-Oakland, who’s running for Feinstein’s seat next year, was thought to be the likely choice. But Newsom last month said he would name a Black woman on an interim basis to complete Feinstein’s term, which ends in January 2025.</p>", "<p>He spoke about his decision on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” where moderator Chuck Todd said, “it would be essentially a caretaker—an African American woman?” </p>", "<p>He explained that choosing one of the Democrats running for the full term — Reps.

I don’t think the people of California want me to make another appointment,” he said on “Meet the Press.”</p>", "<p>His reluctance was about more than navigating a sensitive political decision at moment when he is trying to build his own national brand as Democratic party leader and future presidential nominee. He and Feinstein were close friends with deep personal and political roots in San Francisco. Both were mayors of the city. Both were early champions of gay rights. They were stalwart liberals with a pragmatic streak.</p>", "<p>In a statement Friday, the governor said he and his wife were “deeply saddened.”</p>", "<p>He said “Dianne Feinstein was many things — a powerful, trailblazing U.S. Senator; an early voice for gun control; a leader in times of tragedy and chaos. But to me, she was a dear friend, a lifelong mentor, and a role model not only for me, but to my wife and daughters for what a powerful, effective leader looks like.”</p>", "<p>Newsom has no apparent deadline to make his choice, but Senate Democrats need a successor quickly. Feinstein’s death means the chamber has just 50 members who caucus with the party. That puts the Senate back to where it was in the first two years of the Biden administration, where one Democratic defection can sink a party initiative.</p>", "<p>Feinstein’s death also means the Senate Judiciary Committee, which can approve judicial appointments and send them to the full Senate, is now equally divided between Republicans and Democrats—making it far more difficult to get the nominations to the floor.</p>", "<p>When Feinstein was ailing earlier this year, Democrats tried to replace her, but Republicans blocked that bid. While Democrats will presumably try again to add a member, GOP lawmakers could again stop the appointment.</p>", "<p>Newsom’s pick can take office almost immediately. Most states, including California, allow the governor to name a temporary replacement until the next election. In 2021, he chose Padilla to fill the remainder of Kamala Harris’ term when she became vice president. </p>", "<p>In 1991, Gov. Pete Wilson named Republican John Seymour to succeed him in the Senate when Wilson became governor. Seymour then lost the 1992 election to Feinstein.</p>", "<p>After Lee made her comments last month, Newsom adviser Anthony York replied that there was no vacancy to discuss and none appeared imminent. “This is a hypothetical on top of a hypothetical. There is no vacancy for any U.S. Senate seat, nor does the Governor anticipate there will be,” he said.</p>", "<p>Feinstein had previously said she would retire at the end of her six-year term in January 2025. Lee has been third in recent polls, behind Schiff, D-Los Angeles, and Porter, D-Orange County, in the race for the full term.</p>", "<p>Lee, a congresswoman since 1998, is highly regarded in the progressive and Black community. </p>", "<p>“If Representative Barbara Lee is not Governor Newsom’s choice, I believe it would be a huge political miscalculation for him. With Governor Newsom’s potential national political ambitions, he will need to be seen as someone that can be trusted by an incredibly energized voting bloc,” said Aimee Allison, president and founder of Oakland-based She The People, a political network of women of color </p>", "<p>Newsom has had a difficult relationship with the Black community, starting with his choice of Padilla. The governor was asked by MSNBC’s Reid if he would name a Black woman if another appointment came up.</p>", "<p>“I have multiple names in mind. We have multiple names in mind — and the answer is yes,” he said.</p>", "<p>Newsom didn’t name names.</p>", "<p>Those most prominently mentioned include Karen Bass, a former congresswoman and now the mayor of Los Angeles, though she’s regarded as unlikely to leave that job.</p>", "<p>Also in the mix could be Reps. Sydney Kamlager-Dove, D-Los Angeles, seen as rising star in Washington; Maxine Waters, D-Los Angeles, a longtime outspoken progressive; Secretary of State Shirley Weber and San Francisco Mayor London Breed. </p>", "<p>The Senate today has no Black women, and there have been only two in the chamber’s history, Harris, who served from 2017 to 2021, and Sen. Carol Moseley Braun, D-Illinois, who served one term in the 1990s.</p>"]},

He fired offensive coordinator Walt Bell on Sunday and promoted Rod Carey to that role.</p>", "<p>\"In four FBS games, we've only scored three touchdowns in meaningful minutes,\" Allen said when introducing Carey. \"Just not good enough.\"</p>", "<p>Carey has been around the block in the college football world. He was the head coach at Northern Illinois from 2013-18 and at Temple from 2019-21, before joining Tom Allen's staff in 2022 as a quality control coach. He stepped in as the interim offensive line coach last season after Darren Hiller was fired, and is in a similar spot now, filling in as offensive coordinator midseason after Bell's dismissal. </p>", "<p>Despite the lack of offensive production so far and a difficult schedule ahead, Carey's press conference didn't have the feel of a morbid situation. Sure, the new offensive coordinator said multiple times that the unit has to improve and score more points, that part is understood. But from joking with Indiana staffers and reporters, to his emphasis that the offense has shown enough flashes to get one excited, Carey seemed comfortable in his first time speaking about his new job. </p>", "<p>\"The crazy thing is, they see the flashes, and they have good confidence,\" Carey said when describing the players on IU's offense. \"There isn't a lot of '[Win] one for the Gipper' speeches that you got to do here. They want to be good, and they have a lot of energy to do that. I think that's my job just to get in there and prod that along.\"</p>", "<p>Carey said he wouldn't get into potential schematic or personnel tweaks on Wednesday. He also takes over for Bell as Indiana's quarterbacks coach, but declined to share insight into the starting quarterback situation. Tayven Jackson has started the last three games, but he was replaced by Brendan Sorsby late in the Maryland game. </p>", "<p>For what it's worth, there probably will be very few systematic changes made under Carey due to the nature in which he became the offensive coordinator. He can build off and an improve upon what Bell left behind, but he can't just scrap an offensive philosophy mid-season and install a new offense. </p>", "<p>\"The setup is the setup, the offense is the offense,\" Carey said. \"And so what you're trying to do is get us to run those plays better, and maybe do it with a different little flare here. That's about all you can do. I'm excited about it, and I think the guys are to, [having been] with the offense the last two days and with the offensive staff. We've had flashes, so we need to make those flashes more permanent light-on.\"</p>", "<p>Many took issue with the play calling of Bell, as well as his comment in September <a href=\"https://www.si.com/college/indiana/football/jacks-take-offensive-coordinator-walt-bell-answer-about-indiana-football-offensive-identity-is-concerning\">that he viewed Indiana identity as a run-first offense</a>. This was said despite the Hoosiers ranking near the bottom of FBS in advanced metrics that measure rushing efficiency, and averaging a brutal 3.2 yards per carry as a team. </p>", "<p>Too often, Indiana called designed quarterback runs for Jackson, or carries up the gut for the team's smallest player, Jaylin Lucas. Neither worked consistently.</p>", "<p>That's where Carey comes in. He might not have wholesale adjustments or new play concepts to introduce, but he was adamant about one thing overall — he's going to have Indiana's offense stick to what it does best.</p>", "<p>\"I have a real easy philosophy on offense,\" Carey said. \"You ask me, 'What do you like running on offense?' and I say, 'What works.'\"  </p>", "<p>\"That's really all it is, what works. Misdirection, running, throwing, controlling the ball, controlling the game — I believe that offenses control the game. Defenses [can] play really well and an offense can control the game. Doesn't always go like that for everybody all the time, but Coach Allen and I talked a lot about this ... That's the belief, that if we can control the game, you obviously have to score points, but you got to control the game.\"<br><br></p>", "<p>While no aspect of the 2023 Indiana offense has been great, the passing attack has certainly been more potent than the ground game. The Hoosiers are 70th in expected points added (EPA) per play on plays where they drop back to pass, and 127th in designed runs, <a href=\"https://www.cfb-graphs.com/\">according to CFB-Graphs</a>. </p>", "<p>If that trend continues, expect Carey to lean toward a more pass-heavy offense. </p>", "<p>Part of Bell's run-first approach this season included several different option plays, both of the triple option and speed option variety. Neither worked that well in any game this season, most notably when Jackson lost 11 yards on 4th and 1 against Maryland.</p>", "<p>There's no way to be certain what Carey believes about each of his players. But if he thinks they're struggling to make the correct reads in the triple option, it won't be called very much in the new Indiana offense.</p>", "<p>\"Reads necessarily aren't going to change,\" Carey said. \"But maybe we're going to do more of the ones that they read better, and less of the ones that they don't read as well.\"</p>", "<p>There's a lot of guesses one could make as to what Indiana's new offense will look like under Carey based on his Wednesday answers. But truth be told, no one will know for sure until it's actually seen on the field, when the Hoosiers travel to Ann Arbor on Saturday, Oct. 14 for their next game.</p>", "<p>From the quarterback situation, to adjustments Carey may or may not make, Indiana moves forward with plenty of unknown. But as Carey put bluntly, he's focused on running what works.</p>", "<ul><li><strong>NCAA MAEKES CHANGE TO TRANSFER PORTAL:</strong> The NCAA will now have a 45-day transfer portal window for all sports.

But considering how good he looked in the second half of the season, there’s reason to be optimistic for the 35-year-old in 2024, even if the Yankees bring in another hitting coach.</p>", "<p>Before going over LeMahieu’s up-and-down season at the plate, it’s worth mentioning that his defense, while regressing slightly, is still solid. Unlike 2022, where he was consistently rotated at first, second, and third base, 2023 saw him primarily at the corner infield positions, with just nine games played at second base. Although his range has decreased from the previous season, he still ranks at the 72nd percentile in that category on Baseball Savant. In terms of Outs Above Average (OAA), LeMahieu was better as a third baseman than as a first baseman, with +3 at third as opposed to -2 at first.</p>", "<p>As for his hitting, a strong second half would ultimately level out a poor first half. </p>", "<p>In the first half, LeMahieu looked like a shell of himself, with a .220/.285/.357 slash line and a 77 wRC+. It was extremely alarming to see LeMahieu, the team’s primary contact hitter, fail to make contact in most of his at-bats; he was striking out in nearly 25% of his at-bats, which was nearly double his rate from 2022. He wasn’t getting on base, either; after submitting a career-high 12.4% walk rate, that rate sharply declined to a 7.9% walk rate in the first half. LeMahieu had a particularly brutal June, slashing just .172/.226/.310 with a 45 wRC+ that month. </p>", "<p>But on July 9, hitting coach Dillon Lawson was fired and Sean Casey replaced him the next day. This ultimately marked the turning point in LeMahieu’s season.</p>", "<p>In addition to having a similar hitting approach, Casey helped quicken up the 35-year-old’s lower-half mechanics in his swing. LeMahieu suffered through a nagging toe injury near the end of 2022 that ultimately led to him not playing in the postseason that year; although he avoided surgery during the offseason, the injury likely threw off his swing mechanics and decreased his bat speed/duration in the strike zone. The changes Casey recommended for LeMahieu were subtle, but quickly yielded results.</p>", "<p>In the second half of the season, LeMahieu looked much more like himself at the plate. He slashed .273/.377/.432 with a 129 wRC+, had a 14% walk rate, and showed more power with nine doubles and eight home runs. In particular, he had a torrid August by slashing .291/.391/.506 with a 152 wRC+. </p>", "<p>Overall, LeMahieu’s final numbers were unremarkable and a clear regression from the previous season, although the very poor first half was responsible for most of that damage. These numbers, coupled with both personal and team expectations, will ultimately hurt his final grade for the season.</p>", "<p>However, the strong second half that helped salvage the stat line did something far more important than improving a season grade. Regardless if Sean Casey does or doesn’t return as hitting coach, LeMahieu was able to rediscover what made him such a valuable hitter, and that bodes well for 2024. If he can post his second half numbers over the course of a full season, the Yankees will have a restored fixture in their lineup.</p>", "<p><strong>Grade: C+</strong></p>", "<p><strong>Next Player: Anthony Volpe</strong></p>", "<p><i>Copyright ABG-SI LLC.

The health system is developing its own AI \"code of conduct.\"</p>", "<p>\"We're not going to rush,\" Kelly said. \"I think it's really important to make sure that we do have the right safeguards in place before we just deploy technology like this into the wild.\"</p>", "<p>Dr. Lee Schwamm, professor of biomedical informatics and data sciences at Yale School of Medicine, said AI is already used in many parts of the U.S. health care system. Machine learning and automation are used widely in financial transactions. \"Conversational AI,\" often used in retail to monitor satisfaction during customer service calls, is beginning to spread into health care. Schwamm think's there is potential to use AI to write clinical notes, and to offer doctors suggestions of possible diagnoses that line up with patient symptoms.</p>", "<p>People working on AI programs in health care, Schwamm said, need to ensure that there is human supervision of what the technology is doing or recommending. And they need to consider how transparent they are with patients.</p>", "<p>\"I think that the bigger question here is really not whether it's going to be part of health care. It's gonna be part of health care, just like it's part of everything else. The biggest question will be: Will you know it when you're interacting with it? And will you know when it has been used in your care?\" Schwamm said.</p>", "<p>One of the first programs Mercy plans to introduce is a chatbot where patients would be able to ask questions and get help understanding their lab results, which often hit patients' online medical portals before medical staff have a chance to reach out and explain what the findings mean, Kelly said. The program should be able to cut back on calls over basic questions, he said, and patients will always be able to reach out to medical staff for more discussion if they want to.</p>", "<p>Another program will take patients' calls and schedule appointments. A third is an internal chatbot tool, where staff can find information about policies and procedures and answer HR-related questions.</p>", "<p>Those first programs are just a few of the roughly 50 ideas Mercy leaders presented to Microsoft, as possible uses for AI in the health system.</p>", "<p>Kelly said these tools aren't expected to come at the expense of jobs. In an industry struggling with staffing shortages, the hope is to reduce the time workers spend on tedious tasks, and give them more time to spend with patients.</p>", "<p>It wouldn't be Mercy's first time adopting this type of technology. Kelly said that for about a year now, Mercy has a machine learning model that predicts roughly when a patient might be discharged, in hopes of preventing people from spending more time in the hospital than they need to.</p>", "<p>In the past, when a doctor determined a patient was ready for discharge, a staff member would then begin calling around, looking for available space at a skilled nursing facility, rehabilitation hospital, or wherever the patient may go next. It may take an extra day or two to find an available slot, which means the patient stayed longer in the hospital than they wanted to, and the hospital would have one less available bed for new admissions.</p>", "<p>Doctors always have the ability to overrule the technology, Kelly said, adding, \"We don't want to have (AI) models performing patient care.\" But in some cases, the prediction model meant that staff could start calling facilities and say, \"\"Hey, four-and-a-half days from now, I will have a patient in need of a slot,'\" Kelly said.</p>", "<p>People working in this field are having conversations with regulators about appropriate safeguards, said Peter Lee, corporate vice president of research and incubations at Microsoft. They are also discussing how to mitigate potential biases that can be introduced by AI.</p>", "<p>Kelly said the health system is taking a measured pace, despite the inclination to adopt AI tools soon.</p>", "<p>\"Health care has a massive staffing shortage, so there's a big desire to move quickly,\" he said. \"But it's counterbalanced by the desire to do this the right way and protect patient safety and privacy.\"</p>", "<p>Lee said he sees potential to use AI to cut back on the time health care workers normally spend on paperwork — from clinical notes, to notes referring patients to specialists, and notes justifying that lab tests or prescriptions should be covered by insurance. It could also be used to inform doctors when there is a clinical trial that a patient could participate in.</p>", "<p>He also thinks the technology can be used as a backstop, to check for errors.</p>", "<p>\"I'm a big believer in using AI as a second set of eyes,\" Lee said. \"Just make sure that any errors, any biases are spotted, and that people are given a chance to rethink a decision or a calculation.\"</p>", "<p>\"Generative AI turns out to be incredibly good at reviewing, and evaluating, and critiquing, and spotting errors,\" Lee said.</p>", "<p>One company that provides electronic medical record software, Epic, has an AI-based tool with Microsoft that helps doctors respond to patient emails more quickly.

Finding different ways to pressure the quarterback. </strong></p>", "<p>The secondary of MSU has been talked about enough, but the defensive line has also left much to be desired. Alabama has noticeably struggled with it comes to their offensive line. </p>", "<p>Even with those issues, the Bulldogs could not generate enough pressure to force mistakes out of quarterback Jalen Milroe. Different blitz packages worked when they were telegraphed by linebackers Jett Johnson and Nathaniel Watson.

After coming off one of the best games of his career against South Carolina, he took a major steps back that caused questioning of his starting role. </p>", "<p>While his protection wasn’t the best, the defense on the Alabama side was better. He was in a giving mood that shone through as he gifted his opponent 3 interceptions, with one being returned for a touchdown. His performance allowed Alabama’s offense to wear down State’s defense with short-field advantages. Rogers did look good when he decided to run the ball, something that should be taken note of moving forward. This needs to be something that he continually has in his back pocket when the pocket breaks down. </p>", "<p><strong>3. Utilizing playmakers.</strong></p>", "<p>In the Week 5 matchup against South Carolina, wide receiver/kick returner Lideatrick \"Tulu\" Griffin had an all-time performance, but was limited to 5 receptions for 21 yards against Alabama. It was rare to see him downfield to make a big play like he did continuously against the Gamecocks. </p>", "<p>The lack of tight-end usage in this new pro-style offense is also something a bit shocking to see.

McManus Pro-Am in Ireland. According to the author, a few newly signed LIV members were gathering in a private bar at Adare Manor, the tournament’s host site. Koepka, Jason Kokrak, Pat Perez and Dustin Johnson were all in attendance.</p>", "<p>Shipnuck writes that Koepka had some pointed words about his decision to accept an offer of “$130 million” from the Saudi-backed league. He apparently had even stronger sentiments about those who questioned his character along the way. </p>", "<p>The five-time major champion also allegedly revealed that he “cried” on the phone with his mother after signing the lucrative deal. </p>", "<p>The excerpt read:</p>", "<p>“‘F--- all of those country club kids who talk s--- about me,” he said, referring to the likes of Justin Thomas, Jordan Spieth and others. “You think I give a f--- what they think? You think I care what people say about me? I just had three surgeries, and I’m supposed to turn down $130 million? I grew up with nothing. After signing that contract, the first person I called was my mom. We both cried.’” </p>", "<p>It appears things may have changed since Koepka’s late-night rant. He was the lone LIV golfer to play in last week's Ryder Cup at Marco Simone, and although the <a href=\"https://www.si.com/golf/news/once-again-losing-us-ryder-cup-team-wonders-what-went-wrong-on-road\">U.S. team lost by a significant margin</a>, many of the players insisted that the group was one of the closest they’ve been a part of. </p>", "<p>“I said it before the event, I thought this was the closest team that I think I've been on.

According to the author, <a href=\"https://www.si.com/golf/tag/tiger-woods\">Tiger Woods</a> was at the center of the effort to keep the LIV golfer out. </p>", "<p>“Mickelson was snubbed from a private dinner for Open winners held in the R&amp;A clubhouse.

No one spoke against the project at Tuesday’s meeting but CRLA hasn’t dropped the issue.</p>", "<p>“All of the supervisors have used the money on projects in unincorporated areas,” said Jensen, noting he didn’t attend the meeting due to illness. “The fund was created to push funds out to disadvantaged communities in the county and instead it is being spent for people in the city.” </p>", "<p>Jensen said he doesn’t dispute the need for the soundwall to dampen the noise from 132 traffic, but the spending contradicts the county’s stated policy.</p>", "<p>The county budget approved by supervisors Sept. 20, 2002, said each board member can work with county Public Works on Building Community Infrastructure Fund projects but the “use of funds must be of public benefit to and located in the unincorporated community.” A Feb. 28 <a href=\"https://www.stancounty.com/bos/agenda/2023/20230228/DIS01.pdf\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"Follow\">county report</a> on the proposed soundwall says the project is not in the county unincorporated area but “lies within the city limits.”</p>", "<p>Jensen said many people in Withrow’s District 3 in west Modesto live without basic urban improvements including sidewalks and wastewater hookups, and high-priority projects have been identified in his district.</p>", "<p>Withrow responded Tuesday that he took exception to the CRLA letter and told the group he was disappointed after the county dedicated $50 million in ARPA funds to unincorporated islands.</p>", "<p>Withrow said he allocated the other $1.5 million under his control in the Building Community fund to supplement millions in ARPA funds that will address deplorable conditions in the Riverdale Park Tract.

McCarthy may have offered some clues in January as to who could follow him. But most Republicans were reluctant to speculate, and others said they just didn’t know what or how things would unfold.</p>", "<p>They knew this much: Tuesday was another chapter in the recent history of Republican speakers unable to survive (though none was voted out like McCarthy). If anything, that history suggests surprises are likely.</p>", "<p>In 1998, centrist Republicans had to recruit Dennis Hastert, then a lower-ranking member of the House leadership, to take the job after Newt Gingrich was pressured to resign and other top-ranking Republicans couldn’t get the support of the caucus.</p>", "<p>In 2015, GOP leaders had to cajole Paul Ryan, then a committee chairman, to succeed the frustrated John Boehner after he resigned.</p>", "<p>Now comes the task of replacing McCarthy, the Bakersfield Republican who <a href=\"https://www.fresnobee.com/news/politics-government/article270871092.html\">needed 15 ballots </a>to win the job in January, only to endure nothing but turmoil for nine months until he was toppled Tuesday.</p>", "<p>Under House rules, he <a href=\"https://rules.house.gov/sites/republicans.rules118.house.gov/files/documents/Rules%20and%20Resources/118-House-Rules-Clerk.pdf\">submitted a list </a>to the clerk of the House in January of members who could replace him should he be unable to serve.</p>", "<p>While those names are unknown, observers thought there were clues on January 7 when he listed members who could be Speaker Pro Tempore to sign legislation in his absence.</p>", "<p><a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/118/crec/2023/01/09/169/7/CREC-2023-01-09-pt1-PgH74.pdf\">Among those listed</a> were Reps. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, Adrian Smith of Nebraska, Rob Wittman of Virginia, Andy Harris of Maryland, Richard Hudson of North Carolina, John Joyce of Pennsylvania and Guy Reschenthaler of Pennsylvania.</p>", "<p>McCarthy’s logical successor would be Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana.

Emmer, who is close to McCarthy, won’t comment on the speculation.</p>", "<p>One negative, though: He chaired the party’s congressional campaign committee last year, when it fell far short of expectations.</p>", "<p>So if not Emmer, what Republican barely known outside of Washington is in line to become Congress’ most powerful player?</p>", "<p>Here are some ideas:</p>", "<p>Leading this pack would be Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York. She came to Washington as a center-right congresswoman from a blue state, but then became a devoted ally of former President Donald Trump. She’s now the fourth-ranking House Republican as chairwoman of the House Republican Conference.</p>", "<p>Stefanik would check several important political boxes. She’d be the first Republican woman to become speaker. She’s only 39 and projects energy. She’s a mother of a two-year-old who can talk with authority about family issues.</p>", "<p>Also on this list is Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee, a physician and Army veteran who chairs the Homeland Security Committee. Republicans have praised his work getting tough on border security and his tough-but-fair demeanor.</p>", "<p>There are some House GOP sages who have been around for years, veterans who leaders rely on for wisdom.</p>", "<p>Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma is probably the standout. He chairs the Rules Committee, so he’s familiar with the complexities of passing legislation. He’s long been active on budget issues, arguing consistently for conservative causes but in a calm, friendly way that wins him a lot of supporters.</p>", "<p>Also mentioned is Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina. He chairs the House Financial Services Committee and has been a close confidante of McCarthy. But he’s opted for the committee post in the past rather than step into leadership.</p>", "<p>Chances are none of the far right lawmakers who were instrumental in ousting McCarthy have much of a shot at speaker, and when asked they tend to mention Emmer.</p>", "<p>If Emmer is not interested, there’s Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., heads the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus, whose members were instrumental in ousting McCarthy.</p>", "<p>While Perry largely stayed out of that fight, more centrist Republicans are unlikely to back a Freedom Caucus official.</p>", "<p>There was chatter in the halls Tuesday that he could try again. After all, he survived 15 ballots in January, eventually wearing down his opposition.</p>", "<p>“If someone replaces him they will not be a better uniter of the Republican party. They will not be a better fundraiser,” said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Vista. “There will not be a better person to bring about diversity.”</p>", "<p>McCarthy, though, said late Tuesday he wouldn’t run again.</p>"]},

And Native communities across the country continue to experience disproportionate increases in overdose deaths despite efforts to prevent and treat drug addiction and overdoses in their communities.</p>", "<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that American Indians and Alaska Natives had the highest drug overdose rates in both 2020 and 2021.</p>", "<p>\"You really have to look at it historically,\" former Lummi Chairman Darrell Hillaire said in a phone call Tuesday. \"There was a truly an act of genocide over generations, whether that be boarding school, stealing the land, taking away the resources that we lived off of.\"</p>", "<p>\"It lives on,\" Hillaire continued. \"The hierarchical system that we have in place was not built for us.\"</p>", "<p>In May, Lummi held a statewide fentanyl summit, bringing together tribal nations and state officials to share stories and seek solutions to the crisis.</p>", "<p>Tribes across the state have built wraparound wellness programs — medication-assisted treatment programs, counseling, cultural programming, transitional living — for their members and, often, the greater community. But fentanyl has strained their providers and treatment options and, in some cases, led to long waitlists for services.</p>", "<p>\"We have been in existence since '88 ... we've seen the historical and intergenerational trauma,\" said Rebecca Crocker, executive director of the Healing Lodge of Seven Nations, in Spokane Valley. \"And now on top of that, we're dealing with fentanyl.\"</p>", "<p>The Tulalip Tribes have 5,200 members. Since 2017, the tribe has documented 41 overdoses, 25 of those from fentanyl, Tulalip Chairwoman Teri Gobin said at the May summit.</p>", "<p>\"It seems like almost once a month, sometimes twice a week we are going to funerals. It's exhausting,\" Gobin said. \"And it's getting a lot of young people. I just recently had a great-niece, 17 years old, pass away from fentanyl.\"</p>", "<p>\"It's becoming the norm,\" she continued, \"and it shouldn't be that way.\"</p>", "<p>Cantwell held a series of fentanyl crisis roundtable discussions around the state and attended the National Tribal Opioid Summit in Tulalip this summer. In August, Cantwell secured about $10.5 million in funding for Washington communities and tribes, including Yakama Nation and the Seattle Indian Health Board, to address the fentanyl crisis.</p>", "<p>     ___     ©2023 The Seattle Times.

Their strategy could help teleworkers and Gen Z organize, too", "date": "October 3, 2023, 11:33 AM.", "body": ["<p>Student employees in the California State University system announced Tuesday that they are one step closer to forming what they say would be <a href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/education/article274285090.html\">the largest non-academic union of undergraduate student workers</a> in the country. </p>", "<p>The student assistants, with support from the SEIU-affiliated California State University Employees Union, have submitted more than 8,500 digital union cards signed by fellow student workers to the Public Employment Relations Board. That’s more than enough to trigger a union vote.</p>", "<p>Many CSU student assistants say they’re financially independent and need a union to advocate for higher wages, more hours and paid time off for sickness and holidays. They work their student jobs, and sometimes outside gigs, in order to cover basic living expenses such as rent, transportation and groceries.</p>", "<p>Any CSU campus department can hire students to assist full-time staffers with their work. Although the students often complete the same types of work as staffers, they don’t receive any of the benefits or protections unionized workers have. If a student worker gets sick, they can’t get sick pay. Unless they can afford to forgo the hours, they have to arrange to make up the time later. </p>", "<p>The Tuesday announcement comes after months of back-and-forth discussions between the union and the university to determine how many student assistants are actually employed across the CSU’s 23 campuses. That total number would determine how many signed union cards organizers needed to submit, since at least 30% of the represented employees must demonstrate support for a union in order to trigger an election.</p>", "<p>Students submitted more than 4,000 signatures to PERB back in April in the hopes that they would have enough, and they continued gathering support throughout the summer. The union and university system finally agreed in early September that there were around 19,000 student assistants working for CSU, meaning the union would need at least 5,700 signatures to show the required 30% support. </p>", "<p>CSU has until Oct. 12 to respond to PERB’s finding that the students have proof of support for a union election. The board would then set a date for an election. That date would likely be in a few months. </p>", "<p>Cameron Macedonio, a fourth-year journalism student at California State University Fullerton, worked through the summer to recruit thousands of his peers to sign union cards and join as organizers. The 20-year-old has worked as a student assistant for nearly his entire college career and says that student employment is supposed to serve as a safety net for students who need to support themselves financially. </p>", "<p>At the heart of the unionization push is a fundamental disagreement about what role a student job should play. The university says it caps student assistant hours at 20 per week when classes are in session to ensure students have enough time to study and pursue their degree. During break periods, student assistants can work up to 40 hours in a week.</p>", "<p>“Work hours are intended to be flexible to accommodate the academic program of the student,” CSU spokesperson Amy Bentley-Smith previously wrote to The Sacramento Bee in an email, “ensuring they can focus on their education, progress to (a) degree and participate in opportunities that support and enhance their education, such as internship and research opportunities.”</p>", "<p>But students who are financially independent, and in many cases first-generation, have told The Bee that the CSU is misguided for believing that 20 hours of pay at minimum wage is enough to afford living expenses.</p>", "<p>Twenty hours a week at the state minimum wage of $15.50 an hour, or $310 a week, isn’t enough income to cover Macedonio’s $1,400 rent, let alone other expenses like food, utilities and his car payment. He takes on outside gigs, such as DoorDash, when he can. But mostly he’s been digging into his savings to make ends meet. </p>", "<p>Some of his peers end up working extra jobs off campus, which he said runs contrary to the university’s goal of giving students time to focus on their classes. </p>", "<p>Still, student employment offers perks that off-campus jobs can’t provide, such as flexibility with scheduling and convenience for students who don’t have their own cars or international students without work permits. That alluring flexibility makes it difficult for students to say no to on-campus work, Macedonio says.</p>", "<p>“It’s almost kind of like a Venus flytrap,” he said. “It’s this thing that looks super appealing, and then once you’re there, you kind of get stuck.”</p>", "<p>In April, Macedonio was working as a general manager for the campus radio station when one day he learned that the station had run out of funds to pay its student workers. He ended up finishing out the <span>academic</span><b> </b>year without pay. </p>", "<p>That experience inspired him to dive deep into union organizing.</p>", "<p>“I thought, ‘If I can’t do something right now for myself, then I want to do something to help make sure this never happens again to anyone, whether it’s in a year from now or 10 years from now,’” Macedonio said.</p>", "<p>Instead of circulating physical petitions or going door-to-door to get student support, Macedonio and other student organizers deployed a digital-only campaign that consisted of emails, texts and social media posts. Students could sign up to support the unionization effort by filling out a form with their name and contact information.</p>", "<p>Macedonio said he could send out emails to nearly 900 student assistants in a matter of minutes. He sent at least three follow-up emails and texts to each person that he contacted. Digital organizing gave the largely Gen Z student assistant population a “home field advantage,” he said, since people his age are less likely to engage with in-person canvassers or answer unsolicited phone calls. </p>", "<p>“I don’t want to overwhelm them. I want them to know that this is a safe, comfortable space for them,” Macedonio said. “They choose when to respond. They choose what information they want to take in. They choose whether or not they have the capacity to engage with this right now.”</p>", "<p>Since organizers like Macedonio were given their own unique sign-up links to distribute to students, CSUEU was able to identify their most active advocates. Macedonio said he was speaking at a news conference only four days after agreeing to help with the signature-gathering effort. </p>", "<p>Digital-only organizing and the use of digital union cards makes it much easier for unions to organize employees who are spread out across a large geographic area – such as California’s state workforce. It’s also easier to reach employees who are teleworking and who wouldn’t normally come into their offices and meet with union representatives.</p>", "<p>Although unions have used electronic methods to sign up new members for some time now, digital-only campaigns are a relatively new and emerging trend in the labor movement. Other unions in California have used digital sign-ups before, but usually organizers meet employees in person through traditional door-to-door canvassing and then provide a tablet or computer for the person to sign up digitally. </p>", "<p>“I think it’s fairly new, but it makes a lot of sense,” said Lorena Gonzalez Fletcher, leader of the California Labor Federation. “Students are obviously easier to reach digitally.”</p>", "<p>Kerianne Steele, general counsel for CSUEU, said PERB in 2018 had originally ruled against allowing digital signatures for union representation petitions. But after backlash from labor organizers, the board worked to change its policies over the next three years. PERB introduced new policies in 2021 that allowed for unions to submit electronic signatures for union recognition petitions. </p>", "<p>“The only way in a modern era to organize a large statewide unit, like CSUEU is so successfully doing, is to have people be able to express their support using digital signatures,” Steele said. “Student workers have signed all sorts of student loan applications digitally. Why can’t they express their support for the union the same way?”</p>"]},

Dianne Feinstein from leaders, lawmakers from California, US", "date": "September 29, 2023, 8:17 AM.", "body": ["<p>Political leaders, lawmakers and organizations from Sacramento, California and the United States paid tribute Friday after U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, California’s longest-serving senator and the nation’s longest-serving female senator, died at the age of 90.</p>", "<p><i>This list is being continuously updated as statements are made available. Here’s what they had to say:</i></p>", "<p>“Senator Dianne Feinstein was a pioneering American. A true trailblazer. And for Jill and me, a cherished friend.</p>", "<p>“In San Francisco, she showed enormous poise and courage in the wake of tragedy, and became a powerful voice for American values. Serving in the Senate together for more than 15 years, I had a front row seat to what Dianne was able to accomplish. It’s why I recruited her to serve on the Judiciary Committee when I was Chairman – I knew what she was made of, and I wanted her on our team. There’s no better example of her skillful legislating and sheer force of will than when she turned passion into purpose, and led the fight to ban assault weapons. Dianne made her mark on everything from national security to the environment to protecting civil liberties. She’s made history in so many ways, and our country will benefit from her legacy for generations.</p>", "<p>“Often the only woman in the room, Dianne was a role model for so many Americans – a job she took seriously by mentoring countless public servants, many of whom now serve in my Administration. She had an immense impact on younger female leaders for whom she generously opened doors. Dianne was tough, sharp, always prepared, and never pulled a punch, but she was also a kind and loyal friend, and that’s what Jill and I will miss the most.</p>", "<p>“As we mourn with her daughter Katherine and the Feinstein family, her team in the Senate, and the people of California, we take comfort that Dianne is reunited again with her beloved Richard. May God Bless Dianne Feinstein.”</p>", "<p>“Senator Dianne Feinstein was one of the greatest public servants that California and our nation has ever known.</p>", "<p>“As the first woman president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, the first woman to serve as mayor of San Francisco, and the longest-tenured woman to serve in the United States Senate, Dianne Feinstein broke barriers, inspired generations of women to run for office, and improved the lives of millions of Americans through her vision, courage, and leadership.</p>", "<p> “From her work to help pass the Assault Weapons Ban in 1994, to her work to safeguard California’s public lands, and her longstanding advocacy for reproductive rights, marriage equality, and LGBTQ+ rights, Senator Feinstein helped build a better America.</p>", "<p> “For years, I witnessed Senator Feinstein’s leadership, when the cameras were on and when they were off. In 2008, when I was re-elected District Attorney of San Francisco, it was Senator Feinstein who swore me in. As a United States Senator, it was my honor to serve the people of California alongside Senator Feinstein.</p>", "<p>“On the Senate Intelligence Committee, we spent a great deal of time together — in classified, bipartisan briefings and hearings — working on issues critical to America’s national security and the stability of the world. Senator Feinstein and I shared a fundamental belief in the importance of strong American leadership. And I saw firsthand how she worked courageously to ensure that our leadership was guided by our nation’s values.</p>", "<p>“In the tradition of so many great Senators from California, she was not only a leader for our state, but for our nation and our world. Through her long career, Senator Feinstein worked across the aisle to help our nation live up to its promise.</p>", "<p>“Doug and I send our prayers to Senator Feinstein’s family.”</p>", "<p>“Dianne Feinstein was many things — a powerful, trailblazing U.S. Senator; an early voice for gun control; a leader in times of tragedy and chaos. But to me, she was a dear friend, a lifelong mentor, and a role model not only for me, but to my wife and daughters for what a powerful, effective leader looks like.</p>", "<p>“She was a political giant, whose tenacity was matched by her grace. She broke down barriers and glass ceilings, but never lost her belief in the spirit of political cooperation. And she was a fighter — for the city, the state and the country she loved. Every race she won, she made history, but her story wasn’t just about being the first woman in a particular political office, it was what she did for California, and for America, with that power once she earned it. That’s what she should be remembered for.</p>", "<p>“There is simply nobody who possessed the strength, gravitas, and fierceness of Dianne Feinstein. Jennifer and I are deeply saddened by her passing, and we will mourn with her family in this difficult time.”</p>", "<p>“I’ve said it before: you can’t tell the story of California — or American politics — without the trailblazing career of Senator Dianne Feinstein.</p>", "<p>“A champion, an icon, and most importantly, a friend — Dianne will be dearly missed. Angela and I are keeping the Feinstein family in our prayers.”</p>", "<p>“Dianne Feinstein was a wonderful friend of the Brown family. I got to know her well over the years and came to deeply appreciate her intensity, devotion to duty and unfailing solicitude for her friends. Dianne was utterly unique and set the bar for those who follow.”</p>", "<p>“Senator Diane Feinstein was an incredible leader! I had the privilege of working closely with her when I led the State Senate. We worked together on California’s water challenges and much more. Sen. Feinstein was always kind, to me and always driven to get results.</p>", "<p>“One story sticks out. She talked to me many times when I led the state Senate about introducing legislation to protect small businesses from frivolous lawsuits brought under the Americans with Disabilities Act. I told her I would work on it and fully intended to do so.</p>", "<p>“Before I could get started, I got a call from a reporter asking me to confirm that I was introducing such a bill., since Sen. Feinstein had announced that I was. I laughed. Any other politician, I would have said ‘What the heck?’ But she was not another politician. She was Senator Diane Feinstein. I respected her and her commitment so much that I only had one choice. I happily introduced the bill and got it passed.</p>", "<p>“Being with her was unlike being with most other politicians. She was driven, and she was always on. She taught me that there’s no substitute for hard work, there is no substitute for caring, there is no substitute for digging deep on something that matters. There is no substitute for never giving up and never giving in. That’s the legacy that Dianne Feinstein leaves to this country and to this state.</p>", "<p>“Diane Feinstein was a remarkable leader whose legacy will live on in California and the nation.”</p>", "<p>“Earlier this morning, we lost a giant in the senate. Senator Dianne Feinstein was one of the most amazing people who ever graced the Senate, who ever graced the country. She had so many amazing, wonderful qualities wrapped up in one incredible human being. She was smart, she was strong, she was brave, she was compassionate.</p>", "<p>“But maybe the trait that stood out most of us was her amazing integrity. Her integrity was a diamond. Her integrity shone like a beacon across the Senate and across the country for tall to see and hopefully emulate. Dianne Feinstein would typically say when you asked her how was she voting on something, let me study this issue before taking a position. Let me go home and read on it. And when she came back, if she believed the cause of the vote was right and vital to many issues she cared about, she not only voting for it, there was no stopping her from getting it done.</p>", "<p>“She would take on any force, any special interest, any opponent with relentless integrity and would wear those opponents down until she succeeded. Again, her integrity just shone through them — shone through them and she won and she won and she won and each time made the country a better place.</p>", "<p>“I saw this up close when she passed the assault weapons ban, a passion of hers after what happened in California. The NRA was a relentless and often mean-spirited and chauvinistic faux. They didn’t scare her. They didn’t stop her, and they failed against her. Like most of her opponents, they failed against her. Her perseverance, her strength and most of all her integrity shone through. ...</p>", "<p>“She’s in a class of her own. Of course, it wasn’t just the assault weapons ban she fought for. She protected oversight authority during the investigation into U.S. torture, fighting for climate justice, fighting for marriage equality, fighting for reproductive justice. The list goes on and on. As chair of the intelligence committee, Dianne fought for what was right, even if it was hard and difficult and took months and years to dig in and find out what actually went wrong.</p>", "<p>“She never stopped. She took on the CIA and asserted Congress’s oversight authority during the investigation into the United States use of torture. And through all of her accomplishments, this one and others, she always displayed the quintessential grace, no one rattled her.</p>", "<p>“I remember a few years back when a particularly nasty senator tried to put Senator Feinstein down in a condescending, many would say chauvinistic way. She reacted not defensively but with integrity, and within three minutes she put this colleague in his place, and by the end of it, everyone in the room on both sides of the aisle were smiling. That was Dianne to a T, powerful, prepared, unflappable. She had to be.</p>", "<p>“Whenever she did something, she was often the first to do it. She was elected as the first woman president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, the first woman to serve as mayor of San Francisco, the first woman to serve as U.S. senator of California, the first woman to serve the intelligence committee. And the list goes on and on and on.</p>", "<p>“Our nation will be forever thankful to Dianne Feinstein for the accomplishments she fought for. I too am personally indebted to Dianne, not just as a colleague, which of course I am in so many ways as a colleague, but as a friend and a father of two daughters.</p>", "<p>“Dianne’s work extended far beyond the United States Senate floor as she gave a voice, a platform being a leader to women throughout the country for decades.</p>", "<p>“She didn’t just push down doors closed for women, she held them open for generations of women who followed her. ... She gave a voice, a platform, a model for women across the country who aspire to roles in leadership, in public service who want to leave their own mark on the world, who want to make this country a better place for others.</p>", "<p>“Today there are 25 women serving in this chamber and every one of them would admit they stand on Dianne’s shoulders. So Dianne’s impact extended far beyond the Senate floor and far beyond politics itself.</p>", "<p>“So today we grieve. We look at that desk and we know what we have lost. But we also give thanks — thanks to someone to brave, to graceful of presence served in — that someone like that served in this chamber for so many years.</p>", "<p>“In closing, let me just say this. The sign of after leader is someone — of a leader is someone who dedicates the whole of their spirit for a cause greater than themselves, the sign of a hero is someone who fights for others, who endures for others, no matter the cost, no matter the odds, and a sign of a friend is someone who stands by your side to fight the good fight on the good days and on the bad. Dianne Feinstein was all of this and more, friend, a hero for so many, a leader who changed America for the better.</p>", "<p>“As the nation mourns this tremendous loss, we know how many lives she impacted and how many class ceilings she shattered along the way — shattered along the way. America is a better place because of Senator Dianne Feinstein. Today I join with my colleagues in mourning our beloved friend and colleague.”</p>", "<p>“Mr. President, yesterday, the senior senator from California came onto the floor through those doors to do her job. She voted. She voted to make sure that our country would continue to move forward and not shut down.</p>", "<p> “That was Dianne. She did her job every day.</p>", "<p> “She cared about her country. She cared about her state. She cared about doing a job, no matter how tough it is, for the future of America. And she did it with dignity and respect every single minute.</p>", "<p> “Today, you will hear accolades from across the country. Lists of her legislative accomplishments, from her early days all the way through her career.</p>", "<p> “What I just want to say today — it is a true loss to America. It is a loss to her family—my heart is with you.</p>", "<p> “It is a loss to her colleagues from California, who have served with her and know her as I do—as a tower of strength.</p>", "<p> “To our colleagues on the floor who have worked with her on a laundry list of legislation that you will hear about, and that is way too long to list today.</p>", "<p> “To her constituents, you need to know: we depended on her, just as you did. And she was here every day to fight for you — no matter what.</p>", "<p> “She fought for women. She fought for those who were victims of gun violence. She fought for foreign policy that was remote to most people, but she knew every detail.</p>", "<p> “And when Dianne spoke, the rest of us stopped, and we listened.”</p>", "<p>“Moments ago, the flags over the Capitol were lowered in memory of Senator Dianne Feinstein. As California’s longest-serving senator, Senator Feinstein broke barriers and blazed a trail for women. Her career was by any standards historic.</p>", "<p>“Speaking personally, I worked with the senator for quite some time, together on many different bills, but the one that I think stands out was our water legislation. It was historic. It was the first time in California history in more than 25 years that we were able to pass water. It was the WIIN Act. </p>", "<p>“And I remember the hours and the nights that we would have to work to try to work through, and the challenges — we come from different parties, we have different philosophies, but we put our state first. At the same time, Barbara Boxer opposed it. It was one of the last votes in the Senate that had more than 70 votes at the time.</p>", "<p>“And I believe at the end of the day, the trailblazing of the first woman elected mayor, even coming from a different party, inspired women from both sides of the aisle to seek elected office and to have their voices heard. My deepest condolences to her family, her colleagues and to her staff.”</p>", "<p>“Paul, my daughter Nancy Corinne and I were heartbroken to learn of the passing of our dear friend Dianne Feinstein. For decades, Senator Feinstein was a pillar of public service in California: from San Francisco’s City Hall to the United States Capitol. Her indomitable, indefatigable leadership made a magnificent difference for our national security and personal safety, the health of our people and our planet, and the strength of our Democracy.</p>", "<p>“Dianne was a pioneering woman leader, who served as San Francisco’s first female Mayor with unmatched courage, poise and grace. Standing strong amid horror and heartbreak – from the brutal murders of Harvey Milk and George Moscone to the deadly HIV/AIDS epidemic – she offered our City a beacon of strength and hope.</p>", "<p>“In the United States Senate, she was a champion for the Golden State: bringing home billions of federal dollars while defending our state’s natural wonders. Blazing trails as the first woman to lead the powerful Intelligence Committee, she bolstered America’s moral standing and national security with her fierce opposition to the use of torture. On the Judiciary Committee, she authored and passed the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, which helped stem the tide of mass shootings for the ten years it was law and continued urging its renewal as an essential template for ending gun violence. A fierce champion for gender justice, her tireless advocacy was consequential in securing the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.</p>", "<p>“Personally, it was a great honor to serve alongside Dianne for decades – from the hilly streets of San Francisco to the hallowed halls of Congress. We were not only colleagues, but neighbors and friends. My daughter, Nancy Corinne, has long been an admirer and devoted friend of Senator Feinstein, and we were all close friends with her and her late husband, Richard.</p>", "<p>“Dianne’s extraordinary career will continue to inspire countless young women and girls to pursue public service for generations to come. May it be a comfort to her daughter Katherine and her husband Rick, her granddaughter Eileen, and the entire Feinstein family that all Americans joins them in mourning at this sad time.”</p>", "<p>“I’m deeply saddened by the passing of Dianne Feinstein. She blazed trails for women in politics and found a life’s calling in public service. I’ll miss her greatly as a friend and colleague and send my condolences to all who loved her.”</p>", "<p>“For the past several decades, California has been blessed by the public service and leadership of Senator Diane Feinstein.</p>", "<p>“Senator Feinstein’s trailblazing career inspired multiple generations to take action against violence and injustice in the United States and around the world. She has left a legacy that will serve as the standard for Californians and all Americans to strive for. My thoughts and prayers are with Senator Feinstein’s family and close friends at this time.”</p>", "<p>“I am heartbroken by the loss of my dear friend Dianne Feinstein. Dianne was a trailblazer, a giant of California politics, and one of the most brilliant legislative minds we have ever known. She was a champion for equality and a fighter who unwaveringly spoke truth to power. </p>", "<p>“Her work empowered the most marginalized and underrepresented Americans. She broke down barriers everywhere she went, but it was her monumental achievements and ability to deliver results that redefined effective leadership. A relentless champion of gun safety, LGBTQIA+ rights, the environment, and women’s rights — Dianne was always focused on tackling the nation’s toughest problems. Yet, through it all, she brought her distinctive grace, compassion, and brilliance to every room she entered. Dianne was a special person, an extraordinary American, and I was lucky to call her a close friend. </p>", "<p>“We all owe Senator Dianne Feinstein a debt of gratitude for her public service to our country. My prayers are with all of her family and friends during this difficult time. Dianne will truly be missed.”</p>", "<p>“Dianne Feinstein was a titan of the Senate and her passing is an incalculable loss to California, the Senate, and the country. Though we disagreed on much, I always found her approachable, reasonable and sincere. She was instrumental in advancing desperately needed forest management reforms, even when it meant bucking strident voices on the left. Her presence will be keenly missed, but her example will live on.”</p>", "<p>“Dianne Feinstein dedicated her life to public service and leaves a legacy without comparison in the history of California. Her passing is a profound loss for our state and our country. My prayers are with her family and loved ones.”</p>", "<p>“Senator Dianne Feinstein was a patriot and an incredible champion for the people of California. As California’s longest-serving and first female senator, she was a fighter and a trailblazer for women across California and the nation. We worked together to improve California’s water infrastructure, expand access to healthcare, and modernize our transportation systems. She made a difference every day during her long tenure in public service.”</p>", "<p>“It’s a sad day for the people of California and for our nation. Dianne was my friend and a mentor to me for over 33 years, I will miss her. May she rest in peace — there is no one like Dianne.”</p>", "<p>“Today California lost a champion and the United States Congress lost one of its most prolific leaders.</p>", "<p>“Senator Dianne Feinstein devoted her life to public service and to the betterment of all Californians. She was thrown into the fire when she became Mayor of San Francisco and led with grace and a steely nerve ever since, making a lasting and meaningful difference in our golden state. Her work to defend abortion and LGBTQ rights and protect our children from the horrors of gun violence was a testament to California’s values. I will always remember her deep understanding of the nuances of policy and local funding in the Inland Empire, and our region owes so much to her stewardship.</p>", "<p>“As the first woman Senator from California, her legacy has raised the bar for future leaders in our state. The entire House Democratic Caucus, especially our California delegation, extends our condolences to the Feinstein family. May we all work to carry her legacy forward.”</p>", "<p>“Today, the nation has truly lost a giant of the U.S. Senate, California has lost its trail-blazing leader, and I lost a real friend and mentor. Senator Dianne Feinstein was one of the finest legislators we have ever seen, and her accomplishments made our country and world a better place.</p>", "<p>“The Senator’s legacy is unmatched.</p>", "<p>“Senator Feinstein single-handedly pushed an assault weapons ban over the finish line, and never gave up her fight to end gun violence. She fought powerful agencies to investigate and uncover torture – and made sure it would never happen again. She helped protect California’s natural beauty and preserve its lands for generations. And she always fought for LGBTQ rights and women’s equality throughout her career.</p>", "<p>“My thoughts are with Senator Feinstein’s friends, family, and staff at this time, and my heart goes out to them. California and all its citizens are truly indebted to the Senator and her family for her decades of service. We are all better off for her dogged pursuit of policies that made our country a better union.”</p>", "<p>“California lost a trailblazer and a giant today. Senator Feinstein broke glass ceilings for women in politics and fought fearlessly for safer communities free of gun violence. My deepest condolences go out to her family and loved ones.</p>", "<p>“This a monumental day of loss, but Senator Feinstein’s work continues and her legacy lives on.

I wish her loved ones strength during this difficult time.”</p>", "<p>“California — and our nation – has lost an incredible leader who dedicated her career and life to public service, and opened doors for women in politics.

As our Senator she led on gun safety &amp; so many issues.</p>", "<p>“There will never be another Dianne Feinstein.”</p>", "<p>“Senator Dianne Feinstein was a trailblazing leader who positively changed our state and nation in many ways. She demonstrated her deep commitment to the Bay Area by taking an instrumental role in preserving the San Francisco Bay through the creation and expansion of the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge, a critical wetland area. </p>", "<p>“Senator Feinstein was also instrumental in bringing BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) to San Jose. Following the tragic deaths of San Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone, Senator Feinstein’s resolute leadership reinforced her reputation as a courageous and compassionate icon. Her subsequent work in advancing gun control and public safety has protected many lives. </p>", "<p>“Pattie and I extend our heartfelt condolences to Senator Feinstein’s family.”</p>", "<p>“Senator Feinstein led a distinguished career of public service to California.

Senator Feinstein and her family are in my prayers as California grieves the loss of an icon.”</p>", "<p>“Senator Feinstein was a trailblazer in every sense of the word, and her passing is a great loss to many, including the people of California whom she dedicated her life to serving.</p>", "<p>“From her time as Mayor of San Francisco, where she brought the city together in the wake of tragedy; to her selfless service in the Senate, where she led the fight to ban assault weapons and protect our environment, her leadership was second to none. That’s what she will be remembered for, not just to our great state, but to communities across this country.</p>", "<p>“During this difficult time, I send my deepest condolences to her loved ones, including her daughter Katherine and her entire family, as well as her team in the Senate.”</p>", "<p>“We are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Senator Dianne Feinstein, a trailblazer and tireless advocate for equality and justice. Senator Feinstein devoted her life to serving the people of California and our nation, championing LGBTQ+ civil rights, reproductive freedom, gun safety reform and democracy throughout her remarkable career. </p>", "<p>“Senator Feinstein stood with our community back when few others did, fighting for funding and action to combat the AIDS crisis when most elected officials chose to look away. Her work from the San Francisco Board of Supervisors to the United States Senate transformed our state and our nation for the better.</p>", "<p>“On the Board of Supervisors and then as Mayor, she played a crucial role in uniting San Francisco after the horrific assassinations of Supervisor Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone, demonstrating exceptional leadership and compassion at a time when our LGBTQ+ community needed it most. </p>", "<p>“Now, as we mourn her loss, our community joins Senator Feinstein’s family, friends and loved ones in honoring her extraordinary legacy.”</p>", "<p>“Dianne Feinstein was a true trailblazer for women in California and U.S. politics. Her remarkable breakthroughs included being elected California’s first woman U.S. Senator, San Francisco’s first female mayor, the first female major-party candidate for California governor, and last year, the longest-tenured woman senator in U.S. history. </p>", "<p>“We thank her for being the only member of Congress or Senate to get a weapons ban signed into law, the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban, and reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act to protect us from domestic violence and sexual assault. We will also honor and remember Senator Feinstein for her stellar record on protecting and expanding abortion access and safeguarding our environment, especially California’s desert treasures. She was a true political giant.”</p>", "<p>“Dianne Feinstein was an icon and a trailblazer. She was a fierce, unrelenting champion for our City, our State, and Country. As Mayor of San Francisco, she bravely led us out of dark, difficult times, lifting the spirits and hopes of many who felt lost in the wake of tragedy.</p>", "<p>“As the first woman to serve as Mayor, she showed everyone growing up in this City, including me, what could be accomplished by a strong and determined leader. Dianne Feinstein didn’t just break glass ceilings. She opened up new horizons.</p>", "<p>“As Senator, she fought for the health, safety, and prosperity of everyone in California and the United States.</p>", "<p>“She was a fierce and principled national leader who never backed down from a fight, and worked across divisions to bring people together and make meaningful change.</p>", "<p>“My sympathies and prayers go out to her entire family and all San Franciscans who loved and admired her. Her dedication to public service was only exceeded by her love for San Francisco, and this City loved her back.</p>", "<p>“Her legacy as one of San Francisco’s true leaders will be admired for generations to come. </p>", "<p>“Simply put, there will never be another Dianne Feinstein.”</p>", "<p>“On behalf of Planned Parenthood in California, and really all Planned Parenthood affiliates across the country, I extend our deepest condolences to the Senator’s family, friends, staff, and all who she inspired. Planned Parenthood has nothing but profound gratitude and appreciation for Senator Feinstein’s decades of service and leadership, and certainly the trailblazing path she created for women in politics. Senator Feinstein was a steadfast champion for California and showed the nation what it meant to lead with principle and purpose.</p>", "<p>“Over the years, she stood strongly alongside Planned Parenthood, providers, and patients to protect the right of women and others to control their bodies and make decisions about their futures. For that, Planned Parenthood, and so many others, our deeply grateful. She leaves behind a true legacy to be honored and admired by all.”</p>", "<p>“My condolences to the friends and family of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a trailblazer who witnessed the horrors of gun violence firsthand and fought for a nationwide assault weapons ban. It saddens me that, once again, a leader died in office instead of having an intentional transition that allowed her the dignity in death she deserved and afforded her successor the benefit of her mentorship.”</p>", "<p>“Mourning the passing of @SenFeinstein. Grateful for her decades of service to #California &amp; the American People. Senator Feinstein was a trailblazer who broke countless barriers as a woman in politics, &amp; I will be forever thankful for her remarkable legacy.”</p>", "<p>“This is a huge loss for California. Sen. Feinstein was a profile in courage from the killing of Milk &amp; Moscone to her leadership on gun control &amp; more. She was a hero. My condolences to her family, her staff, and all who loved her.”</p>"]},

But she said it’s a necessary step for anyone that applies to the state.</p>", "<p>The process, according to the CalCareers website, is broken down into three steps: <a href=\"https://www.calcareers.ca.gov/CalHRPublic/Landing/Jobs/Steps.aspx?step=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\">search, exam, apply</a>. The second step, the assessment portion, is where Trejo said she thinks “a lot of our public is confused.”</p>", "<p>“Truly what it is, is an assessment of your skills and your qualifications and so it’s making sure we’re matching you with the correct classification,” she said. </p>", "<p>During the <a href=\"https://www.calcareers.ca.gov/CalHRPublic/Landing/Jobs/Steps.aspx?step=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\">assessment portion</a>, a prospective job candidate is evaluated based on their education, experience, abilities and more, according to CalCareers. This portion of the state job process can look different, including an exam or interview, depending on the job.</p>", "<p>Once a candidate passes the assessment, they can apply for the job.<b></b></p>", "<p>To help, Trejo said people should start by creating a <a href=\"https://www.calcareers.ca.gov/CalHRPublic/Login.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\">CalCareers profile</a>.

But if they lie about them or deceive then it really can’t be mitigated.”</p>", "<p><b>NON-CUSTODY SECTOR</b></p>", "<p>The hiring process looks completely different within the non-custody sector. Typical <a href=\"https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/careers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"Follow\">jobs within the non-custody side</a> include:</p>", "<ul><li>Education</li><li>Fleet management</li><li>Food

exam, your application is what matters.</p>", "<p>Natalie Miller, chief of talent acquisition and career services, said the non-custody job sector is looking for a few things: people who want to expand their knowledge in their field and an accurate and complete application free of misspellings.</p>", "<p>“There’s just a wide variety of opportunities and upward mobility as well...very different as say smaller agencies that don’t have as many opportunities,” Miller said. “And I think that’s our big selling point.”</p>", "<p>“We, on both sides of the house, are more than happy to

Of course I want my three children to be positively impacted! Equally as ", "Relocating to Ripon several years ago, we had no idea what to expect from this small town. Fondly known by the locals as “the jewel of the valley” and “the almond capital” we were excited to embrace everything Ripon. Living in Ripon is very different as compared to living in Portland, Oregon. Our first observation was how often we saw the sun (daily)! We also noticed a change in the school dynamics. In Oregon our children attended newly constructed, state-of-the-art elementary and middle schools in a top-rated district. Teachers were motivated and parents were gloating. These new schools represented us and were a benchmark in safety, security and technology.", "<br/>", "The only elementary school that had availability when registering our children for school in Ripon happened to be Ripon Elementary. Upon voicing my initial hesitations regarding safety and outdated facilities, I accepted the fact that the oldest elementary school in town would now be our new norm. A meeting with the principal assured me that our kids would be welcomed. We quickly learned that life at Ripon El was just as good if not better than the new schools we had left behind.", "<br/>", "Schools in the Ripon district have proven to be a standard of excellence in many ways. Staff dedication, a sense of belonging and the family-like atmosphere are among the extraordinary ways the “old school” on Main Street welcomed my children and our entire family. Our oldest has now graduated from Ripon high school, our middle is a senior this year and our youngest has entered his final year at Ripon Elementary. We do not take for granted what both Ripon El and Ripon High have taught us.", "<br/>", "A few key facts we’ve encompassed along our journey:", "college-level", "<br/>", "It’s not popular to stand up against the majority. As parents we have a moral obligation to teach our kids to educate themselves on facts; and to do that we need to lead by example. Before I answered the call to action letters that were sent by my friends on the grassroots committee, I did my research. What are ways that California schools currently improve and update their facilities? RUSD has a maintenance fund, shouldn’t that be used for replacing leaky roofs? Then I asked the question of fund management and why is deferred maintenance allowed to pile up? Shouldn’t district growth be automatically considered when budget planning? When the money isn’t available or poorly managed, the options I found include: California school bonds, parcel tax, sales tax, fundraising, 501(c)(3) foundation, mello roos, philanthropists who donate specifically to school districts, and grants for school safety and security.", "<br/>", "Is the Measure I bond the answer for RUSD needs? Weigh the facts. What I know is that I’m uncomfortable as a parent and property owner taking on a general obligation bond for 30+ years. This bond is written under the premise that it will allow our students to “… better compete and be prepared for college, career, and competitive job opportunities after high school.” How does a $700,000 new stadium ticket booth and restrooms factor into that? Or the vague $10 million line item stated on the Conceptual Project Cost Estimate that includes the wording “… to improve student learning environments and better prepare students for college and well-paying jobs upon graduation.” We will be paying more in interest than the principal for someone’s opinion that these monies may assist all of our children in being better prepared for college and future jobs. We must take into consideration that some of the statements made on the RUSD mailings and drafts are merely opinions of those in favor and not proven facts. It’s wonderful wording that appeals to the masses.", "<br/>", "My senior has a 4.31 GPA, has passed all of her AP exams to date and is ranked #7 in her class. She accomplished this without bond Measure I, in outdated schools and with the current resources offered by our school district. We have and will continue to see children in Ripon schools achieve this same performance, it’s nothing new. These kids ARE “invested in” and we HAVE “impacted them”. What you are witnessing by the Yes On Measure I movement is emotional campaigning at it’s finest. When you capitalize on emotional marketing, you manipulate feelings which cause emotional triggers. I urge you to set your emotions aside, even if you think you may offend a friend with a different opinion. Consider the facts, educate yourself and VOTE. With certainty we know that there are maintenance issues, outdated schools and growth to deal with. Ask yourself if $38.5 million is an overabundance of principal to cover these issues while keeping in mind you’ll pay an additional $50 million in interest for this general obligation loan. Gifting millions of dollars in tax free interest to the investors of the bond is absurd, but will happen if Measure I passes. Remind yourself that you will be paying off RUSD debt for the next 30+ years by passing Measure I and that you are already funding multiple bonds, which are listed on your property tax bill.", "<br/>", "I’m a NO vote. RUSD will have my continued support through volunteering and financial contributions towards fundraisers, classroom projects, campaigns, and auctions. I will in turn be gratified by knowing exactly how the money was spent.", "<br/>", "Kelly Kiser - Ripon Resident", "#measurei"]},
